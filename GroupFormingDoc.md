## Team Members: 
* Isaiah Martin
* Chase Krivickas
* Suyash Surana
* Rohan Robinson
* Brett Kidman
* Derek Bai

## Q and A

**Who is going to look at which platforms, get a rough task distribution?**

(Informal) Product Manager
* Rohan: Frontend (React, Design, Data Mining/ML)

(Informal) Design Lead
* Brett: Frontend (Digital Arts experience)

Front End 
* Brett: Frontend (Digital Arts experience)
* Rohan: Frontend (React, Design, Data Mining/ML)

Back End
* Isaiah: Backend (some exposure to ML, Backend preference)
* Derek: Backend (ML)

Data Storage
* Suyash: Either frontend or backend (User data storage)
* Chase: Frontend (with some exposure to ML, User data storage)

**Technologies:**
* HTML, Javascript, React, Node.js, MongoDB
* Server to host web application: get Dartmouth servers by reaching out to www.
* Integrating python programming into Node.js, use UNIX system call in Node.js. Research how to talk between Python and Node.js. 
* Datasources for quote/religious text content. (Natural Language Processing) ML algorithm would classify data from source texts. Clustering Example: Which of these 6 quotes do you prefer? 

**Hack a Thing Project:** 
* Integrate ML with Python to Node JS. See if you can make the call through unix system to Python Program
* Possible info for ML w/ Node.JS: https://medium.com/crowdbotics/top-nodejs-libraries-and-tools-for-machine-learning-ae0c106c9a69
* Input from std.in and output from std.out
* Use to call function in unix in Node.JS serverside 

**Design Frameworks?** 
* Photoshop and Illustrator
* Sketch, Figma 

**When are you going to get together? You have to agree on a time to get together outside of the regularly scheduled classes. If you cannot agree on a time with the entire group, I will tell you to use the A hour (as no one is taking classes during the A hour).**

* Thursday class meeting time 2:50pm - 4:40pm EST.
* Tuesday 2-3pm PT. 
* 10-15 hrs/wk work on course minimum


**What is going to be your top priority? What is the single demonstration that you could do that would mean your project is a success. That will be your goal for March 1st.**

We will create a web application in which users can create an account and submit a user survey. Based on this survey, the user will receive a curated list of philosophical, psychological, and possibly musical ideas that they can explore. We will also create a function in which users can enter a specific life difficulty or mood that they are facing, after which they will receive a curated list of quotes from famous philosophers and psychologists which may apply to their situation. 

**What are going to be your stretch goals? List at least one goal for this term and one for the next.**

Stretch Goal Winter Term: 
* Finish building a functional MVP web app (also optimized for mobile) that allows the user to input their preferences, based on those preferences pulls in specific information, and displays that information to the user. 

Stretch Goal Spring Term:
* Create a discussion board under different topics where people can ask questions and receive advice. 

**What git project will you be using (github.com is required, I will be looking at your pushes to determine individual grades) and what git-workflow will you be using (feature branches (good idea), separate sub-repos (usually a bad idea), or a single developer branch? Continuous integration testing (good idea), a test-before-commit policy (bad idea), or a compile-before-commit policy (good idea)?)**

* Feature branches: TBD
* continuous integration testing (Travis CI) 
* Github Repo: https://github.com/chase-krivickas/athena

**What is the license of your project? (you don't have to write open source software, you can also license the software to just your team members, but whatever you choose must be explicit)**

We will license the software to just our team members.
