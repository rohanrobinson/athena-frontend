"Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.'"
'It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.' 
"Such an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'"
"Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must be simple, or complex, or 'ethical,' or 'pathetic.'"
"Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'--while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound of flutes and pipes.'" 
'Critics, he says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy.' 
"'Yes,' we say, 'but the impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality.'"
"In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.'"

'No aim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful.'
'“The little power you might once have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone!', 'Peace be with all the world!'
'If thou feelest it to be for thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer!' 
'“Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder child!'
'I,—a man of thought,—the bookworm of great libraries,—a man already in decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledge,—what had I to do with youth and beauty like thine own!'
'Were it not, thinkest thou, for thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth?'
'Without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny!'
'If they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement!' 
'Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can be better—can be more for God’s glory, or man’s welfare—than God’s own truth?'
'He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!', 'But see, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself!'
'But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record!'
'I pity thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”  “And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend!'

'Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?'
'Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question!'
'“Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us?'
'So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy!'
'Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits!'
'Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together?'
'After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike.'
'Among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister’s miserable experience, we put only this into a sentence:—“Be true!', 'Be true!', 'Be true!'

'Apology.txt' by Plato 

What could be the meaning of this—that he who knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing, should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men?
The question may be asked, Why will he persist in following a profession which leads him to death?
For he will certainly obey God rather than man; and will continue to preach to all men of all ages the necessity of virtue and improvement; and if they refuse to listen to him he will still persevere and reprove them.
Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.
May I succeed, if to succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause!
I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really wiser and better.
But now please to answer the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?
“Let me die forthwith and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the earth.”
For the fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the unknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.
When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil?
For I am quite sure that wherever I go, there, as here, the young men will flock to me; and if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request; and if I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes.
But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?
Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not.

'ThePrince.txt' by Nicolo Machiavelli

Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.  
The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.

'TheRepublic1.txt' by 'Plato'

But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make men more evil?
Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold?
'If because I do evil, Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?'
The language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like--all which tends to show that justice is the interest of the stronger; and that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.'
Is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice? Is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also?
And is not the end of the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained?
'Justice is like the arts in having no external interest, and in not aiming at excess, and justice is to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.'
'virtue is concerned with action, art with production'
Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in the words 'men who are injured are made more unjust.'
'When workmen strive to do better than well, They do confound their skill in covetousness.'
How different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality!
His high character makes him a ruler; he can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.'
"Virtue", as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable."
I hear some one saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which I reply that "nothing great is easy."
Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there are gods?
let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice
that power is the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are public benefits.
What the poets and story-tellers say--that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another's gain?
Has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once?

'TheRepublic2.txt' by 'Plato'

But what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home?
'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.'
For he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to others.
Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another?
If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as a whole.'
Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,' 'harmony;' but while the idea of good embraces 'all time and all existence,' the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.
Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;' the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.'
Admitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another?
Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself?
At the same time, if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself, he must be reminded that 'half is better than the whole.'
'Socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.'
Are the lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?'
Suppose we say that, if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only.,
Now I would ask my good friend, who denies abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view different--the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust?,
And he who grovels in the world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is not a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...,
Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty, truth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask whether they or the many shall be rulers in our State.,
If at this instant a friend whispers to him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be educated--do you think that he will listen?,

'TheRepublic3.txt' by 'Plato'

When mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it?,
Ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything?,
And will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science?,
For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man.,
But if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction?,
And suppose further, that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of light?,
And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world?,
Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way is there from darkness to light?,
No one can fail to see that the contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.',
And so we get four names--two for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion-- being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding: perception of shadows.,
Nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus, 'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.',
Thus liberty, when out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of servitude

'TheRepublic4.txt' by 'Plato'

If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of themselves?,
'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.',

'TheRepublic5.txt' by 'Plato'

We must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy, and that 'which is the most holy will be the most useful.',

'TheRepublic6.txt' by 'Plato'

The question is asked, 'Whether the state of innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own which possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is the preferable condition of man.',
To injure a friend or anyone else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust,

'TheRepublic7.txt' by 'Plato'

The just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike?,
Injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship,
And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?,
But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death?,
Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him? And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?,

'TheRepublic8.txt' by 'Plato'

Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly,
And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?,
And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well,

And what of passion, or spirit?,
Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?,
Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?,
And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the State is just?,
We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class?,
We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?,
And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally?,
Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands and counsels?,
And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?,
And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole?,
And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?,
And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or is she the same which we found her to be in the State?,
If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?,
Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or treachery either to his friends or to his country?,
Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?,
Then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?,
Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should not be telling a falsehood?,
And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will also be perfectly clear?,
And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?,
And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order?,
And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order?,
Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?,
And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?,
I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an argument are you raising about the State!,
For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said Thrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?,
But never mind about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way: What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians?,
and how shall we manage the period between birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?,
Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education?,
First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest, let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at all?,
They will say: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.',
'And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?',
Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?',
'But if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?',
--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?,
Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of contradiction!,
Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with us and our argument?,
Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?,
Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?,
And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy; one has spirit, and another is without spirit?,
And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?,
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same?,
Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better than another?,
You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens?,
And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?,
And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such manner as we have described, will accomplish?,
Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the State?,
And so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other--necessity is not too strong a word, I think?,
Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?,
Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not some better than others?,
my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!,
Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any particular skill?,
That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?,
But how will they know who are fathers and daughters, and so on?,
And now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?,
Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign?,
And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow?,
Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens?,
Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him?,
And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers?,
Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?,
Are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?,
And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?,
And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain?,
And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children?,
And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?,
Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the State?,
Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz.,
Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another?,
That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may often happen in war, how great the danger is!,
Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?,
Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies?,
That the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible?,
Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in the first place, that he is of the golden race?,
Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they are dead  'They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men'?,
We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we must do as he bids?,
Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear!,
Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?,
They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?,
And for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction?,
But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of things possible, and how, if at all?,
I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?,
Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?,
Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the whole class or a part only?,
Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?,
Now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor arts, are philosophers?,
He said: Who then are the true philosophers?,
What is the proposition?,
That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?,
And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?,
Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?,
And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?,
Shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?,
But we should like to ask him a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing?,
(You must answer for him.),
Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?,
And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?,
But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being?,
And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, if there be such?,
Do we admit the existence of opinion?,
Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties?,
Would you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?,
And is opinion also a faculty?,
And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion?,
Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs?,
Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or subject-matters?,
Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to know the nature of being?,
And opinion is to have an opinion?,
or is the subject-matter of opinion the same as the subject-matter of knowledge?,
Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be the subject-matter of opinion?,
Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion?,
Reflect: when a man has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something?,
Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of being, knowledge?,
Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?,
And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?,
But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?,
Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge, but lighter than ignorance?,
Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?,
And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion?,
And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?,
And can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this?,
Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and pure not-being?,
But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only?,
Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them?,
Inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our State?,
And how can we rightly answer that question?,
Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?,
And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?,
And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another quality which they should also possess?,
And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?,
Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?,
Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence, think much of human life?,
Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?,
Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or mean, or a boaster, or a coward--can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard in his dealings?,
Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?,
And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion?,
And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?,
Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being?,
And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,--noble, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?,
Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them?,

Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other?,
Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at variance with present notions of him?,
Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will follow after?,
And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures!,
And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad?,
Do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?,
Do you really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of?,
Are not the public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists?,
And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?,
Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?,
Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?,
Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their assemblies; and this is their wisdom.,
By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?,
And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing?,
Then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?,
And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world?,
Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end?,
Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?,
And what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall proper youth?,
Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?,
And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?,
Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods of life?,
And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated?,
Will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true wisdom?,
A great work--yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State suitable to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.,
The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been shown--is there anything more which you wish to say?,
(Heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every evening and relighted every morning.),
How truly in earnest you are, Socrates!,
But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?,
And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth, will they be angry with philosophy?,
Will they disbelieve us, when we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern?,
And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, until they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of God?,
Why, where can they still find any ground for objection?,
Will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?,
Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the highest good?,
But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?,
Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will this our imaginary State ever be realized?,
Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?,
Will any one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers?,
Who indeed!,
The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?,
And that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or impossibility?,
But what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge?,
You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom?,
And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them?,
What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than justice and the other virtues?,
When little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!,
A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge?,
You can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing.,
Do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good?,
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?,
You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?,
And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?,
And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?,
I am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them.,
And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be perfectly ordered?,
Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, or different from either?,
And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best of them blind?,
And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when others will tell you of brightness and beauty?,
And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense?,
But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?,
Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?,
No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the other senses--you would not say that any of them requires such an addition?,
But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen?,
And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element?,
May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?,
Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by sight?,
Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness of vision in them?,
But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, they see clearly and there is sight in them?,
What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?,
God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another point of view?,
You would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, though he himself is not generation?,
In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.,
Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, how amazing!,
May I suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?,
And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?,
Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?,
And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened:--Behold!,
And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be perplexed?,
He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold?,
And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?,
But is not this unjust?,
And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light?,
Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics?,
And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?,
), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?,
And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change?,
And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?,
Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?,
But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme?,
But what branch of knowledge is there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us?,
Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?,
The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word, number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them?,
But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?,
And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness?,
And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?,
Is not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?,
And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft?,
What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?,
And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?,
Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?',
and 'What is small?',
And to which class do unity and number belong?,
And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?,
And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?,
And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?,
Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the science is!,
and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!,
Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth?,
And next, shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?,
Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming only, it does not concern us?,
Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study?,
And suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?,
Still, I should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?,
Will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner?,
But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them?,
For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?,

Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called understanding.,
But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?,
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?,
And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing?,
And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?,
And you would say the same of the conception of the good?,
), having no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?,
Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?,
Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature of knowledge can no further go?,
For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.,
Indeed!,
Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced?,
But how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy?,
And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore, and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires?,
And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any chance aspirant or intruder?,
Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise--will that be enough?,
Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?),
Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other?,
For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?,
Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of individual minds will also be five?,
In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another?,
Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number (i.e.,
The terms will then be 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, which together = 6 cubed = 216.),
), and the other a figure having one side equal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square (i.e.,
For other explanations of the passage see Introduction.),
And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy?,
Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into being, and what is he like?,
Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises?,
The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do they or their wives care about the law?,
Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?,
Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?,
But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of citizenship?,
Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?,
The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education, ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?,
Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?,
Is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara and chain and scimitar?,
And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?,
Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life?,
Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to the oligarchical State?,
Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?,
Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?,
And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?,
The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:  What other?,
And when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?,
And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases?,
Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human natures?,
And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his youth upwards--of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in some cases the reverse of good--shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary?,
May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money because they conduce to production?,
And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires, whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical?,
And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?,
The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?,
And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?,
And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution?,
Now, in such a State, can liberty have any limit?,
And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?,
That, however, was not, as I believe, your question--you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?,
Do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?,
And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can?,
Then comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career--'Let not the people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.',
And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,  'By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to be a coward.',
At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he salutes every one whom he meets;--he to be called a tyrant, who is making promises in public and also in private!,
Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?,
What a blessed alternative, I said:--to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!,
And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?,
But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be supported by the son?,
Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny?,
Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?,
And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the gods?,
But, O heavens!,
Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?,
and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in general?,
And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the others?,
And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to man?,
Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?,
And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature?,
Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person?,
Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?,
Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?,
And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a State?,
Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule prevail?,
And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman, or of a slave?,
And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?,
And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?,
Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain?,
Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State to be the most miserable of States?,
But do you observe the reason of this?,
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?,

And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?,
Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame?,
Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious--would the term be suitable?,
'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul?,
One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in others, as may happen?,
Will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?,
And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure?,
Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?,
Has the lover of gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain?,
Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for he has a double experience?,
And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?,
Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?,
Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?,
And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the pleasure which is next?,
Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?,
A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about either--that is what you mean?,
And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?,
And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure?,
But can that which is neither become both?,
But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion, and in a mean between them?,
How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?,
You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region?,
Look at the matter thus:--Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions of the bodily state?,
And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?,
And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?,
And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer?,
And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence?,
And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of essence?,
Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul?,
And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?,
What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real?,
And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul?,
And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable?,
But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?,
And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?,
And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order?,
Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure, and the king at the least?,
But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most pleasantly?,
I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?,
And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch?,
And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal and aristocratical?,
Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three?,
And how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!,
(729 NEARLY equals the number of days and nights in the year.),
Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue?,
Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just?,
And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?,
Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?',
But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question: 'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?,
Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received?,
From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness?,
What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?,
And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?,
And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite harm?,
And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?,
I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth?,
Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?,
And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use, in accordance with the idea--that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances--but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how could he?,
For this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants and animals, himself and all other things--the earth and heaven, and the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods also.,
Do you mean that there is no such maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not?,
were you not saying that he too makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but only a particular bed?,
Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is?,
Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?,
Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?,
And what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the bed?,
Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator?,
And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?,
And what about the painter?--I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?,
Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making branch?,
The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good?,
Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?',
Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?,
And is it conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous?,
Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?,
Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, but the truth they never reach?,
That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?,
The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is told by him?,
But will the imitator have either?,
And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?,
Imitation is only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?,
And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?,
And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?,
And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul?,
And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent contradiction?,
But were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?,
Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?,
And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation?,
And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul?,
Though I need hardly raise the question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?,
Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more equanimity than another?,
But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?,
Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?,
But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in him?,
Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason?,
And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call irrational, useless, and cowardly?,
And does not the latter--I mean the rebellious principle--furnish a great variety of materials for imitation?,
Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is easily imitated?,
But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?,
And what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?,
Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?,
He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you really prepared to maintain this?,
Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?,
If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction?,
Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?,
Do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from the body?,
And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?,
But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be immortal?,
And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?,
And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins?,
And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?,
Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?,
But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?,
He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?',
(Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.),
Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser--God is justified.',
And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence.,
Let not him who chooses first be careless, and let not the last despair.',

For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life?,
Secondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights and just Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that Preserveth and Dissolveth it.,
Which Object worketh on the Eyes, Eares, and other parts of mans body; and by diversity of working, produceth diversity of Apparences.,
The Originall of them all, is that which we call Sense; (For there is no conception in a mans mind, which hath not at first, totally, or by parts, been begotten upon the organs of Sense.),
Neither in us that are pressed, are they anything els, but divers motions; (for motion, produceth nothing but motion.),
Nay for the cause of Understanding also, they say the thing Understood sendeth forth Intelligible Species, that is, an Intelligible Being Seen; which comming into the Understanding, makes us Understand.,
But that when a thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat els stay it, though the reason be the same, (namely, that nothing can change it selfe,) is not so easily assented to.,
For in a Discourse of our present civill warre, what could seem more impertinent, than to ask (as one did) what was the value of a Roman Penny?,
First, when men register their thoughts wrong, by the inconstancy of the signification of their words; by which they register for their conceptions, that which they never conceived; and so deceive themselves.,
By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true Knowledge, to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them himselfe.,
In summe, in what matter soever there is place for Addition and Substraction, there also is place for Reason; and where these have no place, there Reason has nothing at all to do.,
To conclude, The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words, but by exact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; Reason is the Pace; Encrease of Science, the Way; and the Benefit of man-kind, the End.,
And on the contrary, Metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words, are like Ignes Fatui; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention, and sedition, or contempt.,
And although unstudied men, doe not conceive any motion at all to be there, where the thing moved is invisible; or the space it is moved in, is (for the shortnesse of it) insensible; yet that doth not hinder, but that such Motions are.,
Good Evill  But whatsoever is the object of any mans Appetite or Desire; that is it, which he for his part calleth Good: And the object of his Hate, and Aversion, evill; And of his contempt, Vile, and Inconsiderable.,
Pulchrum Turpe; Delightfull Profitable; Unpleasant Unprofitable  The Latine Tongue has two words, whose significations approach to those of Good and Evill; but are not precisely the same; And those are Pulchrum and Turpe.,
Therefore of things past, there is no Deliberation; because manifestly impossible to be changed: nor of things known to be impossible, or thought so; because men know, or think such Deliberation vaine.,
For if the intervenient Appetites make any action Voluntary, then by the same reason all intervenient Aversions should make the same action Involuntary; and so one and the same action should be both Voluntary & Involuntary.,
The language of Desire, and Aversion, is Imperative; as, Do This, Forbear That; which when the party is obliged to do, or forbear, is Command; otherwise Prayer; or els Counsell.,
The language of Vaine-Glory, of Indignation, Pitty and Revengefulness, Optative: but of the Desire to know, there is a peculiar expression called Interrogative; as, What Is It, When Shall It, How Is It Done, and Why So?,
And as the last Appetite in Deliberation is called the Will, so the last Opinion in search of the truth of Past, and Future, is called the JUDGEMENT, or Resolute and Final Sentence of him that Discourseth.,
And as the whole chain of Appetites alternate, in the question of Good or Bad is called Deliberation; so the whole chain of Opinions alternate, in the question of True, or False is called DOUBT.,
To Have Faith In, or Trust To, or Beleeve A Man, signifie the same thing; namely, an opinion of the veracity of the man: But to Beleeve What Is Said, signifieth onely an opinion of the truth of the saying.,
So that it is evident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other reason, than what is drawn from authority of men onely, and their writings; whether they be sent from God or not, is Faith in men onely.,
In Demonstration, in Councell, and all rigourous search of Truth, Judgement does all; except sometimes the understanding have need to be opened by some apt similitude; and then there is so much use of Fancy.,
The secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane, clean, obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verball discourse cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the Time, Place, and Persons.,
Acquired Wit  As for Acquired Wit, (I mean acquired by method and instruction,) there is none but Reason; which is grounded on the right use of Speech; and produceth the Sciences.,
For what argument of Madnesse can there be greater, than to clamour, strike, and throw stones at our best friends?,
"Whom I have filled with the Spirit of wisdome to make garments for Aaron," is not meant a spirit put into them, that can make garments; but the wisdome of their own spirits in that kind of work.,
Neither did the other Prophets of the old Testament pretend Enthusiasme; or, that God spake in them; but to them by Voyce, Vision, or Dream; and the Burthen Of The Lord was not Possession, but Command.,
How then could the Jewes fall into this opinion of possession?,
And hence it came to passe, when our Saviour (Mark 3.21.),
some said, "He hath a Divell, and is mad;" whereas others holding him for a Prophet, sayd, "These are not the words of one that hath a Divell.",
So in the old Testament he that came to anoynt Jehu, (2 Kings 9.11.),
was a Prophet; but some of the company asked Jehu, "What came that mad-man for?",
As for that our Saviour speaketh to the disease, as to a person; it is the usuall phrase of all that cure by words onely, as Christ did, (and Inchanters pretend to do, whether they speak to a Divel or not.),
"The first cause does not necessarily inflow any thing into the second, by force of the Essential subordination of the second causes, by which it may help it to worke?",
The former is nothing else, but Sense and Memory, and is Absolute Knowledge; as when we see a Fact doing, or remember it done: And this is the Knowledge required in a Witnesse.,
Consequences from Quantity, and Motion Indeterminate;               which, being the Principles or first foundation of               Philosophy, is called Philosophia Prima                PHILOSOPHIA PRIMA             b.,
Consequences from the Accidents of Politique Bodies; which is         called POLITIQUES, and CIVILL PHILOSOPHY          1.,
And From Love Of Arts  Desire of Knowledge, and Arts of Peace, enclineth men to obey a common Power: For such Desire, containeth a desire of leasure; and consequently protection from some other Power than their own.,
And From The Ignorance Of Naturall Causes  Want of Science, that is, Ignorance of causes, disposeth, or rather constraineth a man to rely on the advise, and authority of others.,
Adhaerence To Private Men, From Ignorance Of The Causes Of Peace Ignorance of remote causes, disposeth men to attribute all events, to the causes immediate, and Instrumentall: For these are all the causes they perceive.,
And Credulity, because men love to be hearkened unto in company, disposeth them to lying: so that Ignorance it selfe without Malice, is able to make a man bothe to believe lyes, and tell them; and sometimes also to invent them.,
For who can believe, that he that doth ordinarily such actions, as proceed from any of these rootes, believeth there is any such Invisible Power to be feared, as he affrighteth other men withall, for lesser faults?,
For who is there that does not see, to whose benefit it conduceth, to have it believed, that a King hath not his Authority from Christ, unlesse a Bishop crown him?,
That whether a Prince be born in lawfull Marriage, or not, must be judged by Authority from Rome?,
That Subjects may be freed from their Alleageance, if by the Court of Rome, the King be judged an Heretique?,
That a King (as Chilperique of France) may be deposed by a Pope (as Pope Zachary,) for no cause; and his Kingdome given to one of his Subjects?,
That the Clergy, and Regulars, in what Country soever, shall be exempt from the Jurisdiction of their King, in cases criminall?,
Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words?,
The Passions That Incline Men To Peace  The Passions that encline men to Peace, are Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them.,
The first branch, of which Rule, containeth the first, and Fundamentall Law of Nature; which is, "To seek Peace, and follow it.",
The Second, the summe of the Right of Nature; which is, "By all means we can, to defend our selves.",
This is that Law of the Gospell; "Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do ye to them.",
And that Law of all men, "Quod tibi feiri non vis, alteri ne feceris.",
Not All Rights Are Alienable  Whensoever a man Transferreth his Right, or Renounceth it; it is either in consideration of some Right reciprocally transferred to himselfe; or for some other good he hopeth for thereby.,
But if the words be of the time Present, or Past, as, "I have given, or do give to be delivered to morrow," then is my to morrows Right given away to day; and that by the vertue of the words, though there were no other argument of my will.,
But because no man can demand a right to it, by his own Righteousnesse, or any other power in himselfe, but by the Free Grace of God onely; they say, no man can Merit Paradise Ex Condigno.,
But in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain those that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform first, is obliged so to do.,
The cause of Feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be alwayes something arising after the Covenant made; as some new fact, or other signe of the Will not to performe; else it cannot make the Covenant Voyd.,
And they that give to a man The Right of government in Soveraignty, are understood to give him the right of levying mony to maintain Souldiers; and of appointing Magistrates for the administration of Justice.,
For though a man may Covenant thus, "Unlesse I do so, or so, kill me;" he cannot Covenant thus "Unless I do so, or so, I will not resist you, when you come to kill me.",
The Passion to be reckoned upon, is Fear; whereof there be two very generall Objects: one, the Power of Spirits Invisible; the other, the Power of those men they shall therein Offend.,
Such was the Heathen Forme, "Let Jupiter kill me else, as I kill this Beast.",
So is our Forme, "I shall do thus, and thus, so help me God.",
And this is also to be gathered out of the ordinary definition of Justice in the Schooles: For they say, that "Justice is the constant Will of giving to every man his own.",
The Kingdome of God is gotten by violence; but what if it could be gotten by unjust violence?,
were it against Reason so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt by it?,
The Fifth, Mutuall accommodation, or Compleasance  A fifth Law of Nature, is COMPLEASANCE; that is to say, "That every man strive to accommodate himselfe to the rest.",
The Sixth, Facility To Pardon  A sixth Law of Nature is this, "That upon caution of the Future time, a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.",
The Seventh, That In Revenges, Men Respect Onely The Future Good  A seventh is, " That in Revenges, (that is, retribution of evil for evil,) Men look not at the greatnesse of the evill past, but the greatnesse of the good to follow.",
And therefore for the ninth Law of Nature, I put this, "That every man acknowledge other for his Equall by Nature.",
The Tenth Against Arrogance  On this law, dependeth another, "That at the entrance into conditions of Peace, no man require to reserve to himselfe any Right, which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest.",
The Eleventh Equity  Also "If a man be trusted to judge between man and man," it is a precept of the Law of Nature, "that he deale Equally between them.",
He therefore that is partiall in judgment, doth what in him lies, to deterre men from the use of Judges, and Arbitrators; and consequently, (against the fundamentall Lawe of Nature) is the cause of Warre.,
The observance of this law, from the equall distribution to each man, of that which in reason belongeth to him, is called EQUITY, and (as I have sayd before) distributive justice: the violation, Acception Of Persons, Prosopolepsia.,
Then, The Law of Nature, which prescribeth Equity, requireth, "That the Entire Right; or else, (making the use alternate,) the First Possession, be determined by Lot.",
The Fifteenth, Of Mediators  It is also a Law of Nature, "That all men that mediate Peace, be allowed safe Conduct.",
And therefore it is of the Law of Nature, "That they that are at controversie, submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator.",
And again, he that shall observe the same Lawes towards him, observes them not himselfe, seeketh not Peace, but War; & consequently the destruction of his Nature by Violence.,
For in that they require nothing but endeavour; he that endeavoureth their performance, fulfilleth them; and he that fulfilleth the Law, is Just.,
Now the science of Vertue and Vice, is Morall Philosophie; and therfore the true Doctrine of the Lawes of Nature, is the true Morall Philosophie.,
And these Authors conditionall, are generally called SURETYES, in Latine Fidejussores, and Sponsores; and particularly for Debt, Praedes; and for Appearance before a Judge, or Magistrate, Vades.,
Thirdly, because the major part hath by consenting voices declared a Soveraigne; he that dissented must now consent with the rest; that is, be contented to avow all the actions he shall do, or else justly be destroyed by the rest.,
These Rights Are Indivisible  These are the Rights, which make the Essence of Soveraignty; and which are the markes, whereby a man may discern in what Man, or Assembly of men, the Soveraign Power is placed, and resideth.,

For the Understanding is by the flame of the Passions, never enlightned, but dazled: Nor is there any place, or time, wherein an Assemblie can receive Counsell with secrecie, because of their owne Multitude.,
Secondly, that King whose power is limited, is not superiour to him, or them that have the power to limit it; and he that is not superiour, is not supreme; that is to say not Soveraign.,
And though the Soveraign assembly, may give Power to others, to elect new men, for supply of their Court; yet it is still by their Authority, that the Election is made; and by the same it may (when the publique shall require it) be recalled.,
And for the question (which may arise sometimes) who it is that the Monarch in possession, hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his power; it is determined by his expresse Words, and Testament; or by other tacite signes sufficient.,
19) "Speak thou to us, and we will heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye.",
Concerning the Right of Kings, God himself by the mouth of Samuel, saith, (1 Sam.,
11, 12, &c.) "This shall be the Right of the King you will have to reigne over you.,
He shall take the tyth of your flocks; and you shall be his servants.",
This is absolute power, and summed up in the last words, "you shall be his servants.",
19 &c.) "We will be as all other nations, and our King shall judge our causes, and goe before us, to conduct our wars.",
9) "Give to thy servant understanding, to judge thy people, and to discerne between Good and Evill.",
It belongeth therefore to the Soveraigne to bee Judge, and to praescribe the Rules of Discerning Good and Evill; which Rules are Lawes; and therefore in him is the Legislative Power.,
9) "God forbid I should do such an act against my Lord, the anoynted of God.",
20) "Servants obey your masters in All things," and, (Verse.,
22) "Children obey your Parents in All things.",
2,3) "The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chayre and therefore All that they shall bid you observe, that observe and do.",
2) "Warn them that they subject themselves to Princes, and to those that are in Authority, & obey them.",
And if any man ask you, what you mean by it, Say the Lord hath need of them: And they will let them go.",
5) "You shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evill.",
hast thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee thou shouldest not eat?",
And thereupon God saith, "Hast thou eaten, &c." as if he should say, doest thou that owest me obedience, take upon thee to judge of my Commandements?,
And whosoever thinking Soveraign Power too great, will seek to make it lesse; must subject himselfe, to the Power, that can limit it; that is to say, to a greater.,
What It Is To Be Free  And according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the word, A FREE-MAN, is "he, that in those things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will to.",
Lastly, from the use of the word Freewill, no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe.,
And therefore God, that seeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the Liberty of man in doing what he will, is accompanied with the Necessity of doing that which God will, & no more, nor lesse.,
For though the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to Equitie, (as was the killing of Uriah, by David;) yet it was not an Injurie to Uriah; but to God.,
Which distinction, David himself, when he repented the fact, evidently confirmed, saying, "To thee only have I sinned.",
40) "If Demetrius and the other work-men can accuse any man, of any thing, there be Pleas, and Deputies, let them accuse one another.,
For we are in danger to be accused for this dayes sedition, because, there is no cause by which any man can render any reason of this Concourse of People.",
And again; "Take away the Civill Law, and no man knows what is his own, and what another mans.",
For he that Exhorteth, doth not deduce the consequences of what he adviseth to be done, and tye himselfe therein to the rigour of true reasoning; but encourages him he Counselleth, to Action: As he that Dehorteth, deterreth him from it.,
But these words, "Sell all thou hast; give it to the poore; and follow me," are Counsell; because the reason for which we are to do so, is drawn from our own benefit; which is this, that we shall have "Treasure in Heaven.",
Secondly, in an Assembly of many, there cannot choose but be some whose interests are contrary to that of the Publique; and these their Interests make passionate, and Passion eloquent, and Eloquence drawes others into the same advice.,
For having power to make, and repeale Lawes, he may when he pleaseth, free himselfe from that subjection, by repealing those Lawes that trouble him, and making of new; and consequently he was free before.,
For he is free, that can be free when he will: Nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe; because he that can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to himselfe onely, is not bound.,
But the Right of Nature, that is, the naturall Liberty of man, may by the Civill Law be abridged, and restrained: nay, the end of making Lawes, is no other, but such Restraint; without the which there cannot possibly be any Peace.,
As for example, "That the Common Law, hath no Controuler but the Parlament;" which is true onely where a Parlament has the Soveraign Power, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved, but by their own discretion.,
It is not meant of any private Reason; for then there would be as much contradiction in the Lawes, as there is in the Schooles; nor yet (as Sr. Ed, Coke makes it (Sir Edward Coke, upon Littleton Lib.2.,
Ch.6 fol 97.b),) an Artificiall Perfection of Reason, Gotten By Long Study, Observation, And Experience, (as his was.),
For whatsoever men are to take knowledge of for Law, not upon other mens words, but every one from his own reason, must be such as is agreeable to the reason of all men; which no Law can be, but the Law of Nature.,
The Lawes of Nature therefore need not any publishing, nor Proclamation; as being contained in this one Sentence, approved by all the world, "Do not that to another, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by another to thy selfe.",
For whatsoever Law is not written, or some way published by him that makes it Law, can be known no way, but by the reason of him that is to obey it; and is therefore also a Law not only Civill, but Naturall.,
And for the same reason Solomon adviseth a man, to bind the ten Commandements (Prov.,
And for the Law which Moses gave to the people of Israel at the renewing of the Covenant, (Deut.,
19) he biddeth them to teach it their Children, by discoursing of it both at home, and upon the way; at going to bed, and at rising from bed; and to write it upon the posts, and dores of their houses; and (Deut.,
For as to the Forfeiture of them, the Law will admit no proofe against the Presumption in Law, grounded upon his flight.",
If the Law ground upon his flight a Presumption of the fact, (which was Capitall,) the Sentence ought to have been Capitall: if the presumption were not of the Fact, for what then ought he to lose his goods?,
Again, the word of the Law, commandeth to Judge according to the Evidence: A man is accused falsly of a fact, which the Judge saw himself done by another; and not by him that is accused.,
Distributive are those that determine the Rights of the Subjects, declaring to every man what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety in lands, or goods, and a right or liberty of action; and these speak to all the Subjects.,
But this Authority of man to declare what be these Positive Lawes of God, how can it be known?,
The Covenant God made with Abraham (in a Supernaturall Manner) was thus, (Gen. 17.,
10) "This is the Covenant which thou shalt observe between Me and Thee and thy Seed after thee.",
Upon what ground, but on this submission of their own, "Speak thou to us, and we will heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye?",
And supposing such a Law were obligatory; yet a man would reason thus, "If I doe it not, I die presently; if I doe it, I die afterwards; therefore by doing it, there is time of life gained;" Nature therefore compells him to the fact.,
And though it be our duty to do, not what they do, but what they say; yet will that duty never be performed, till it please God to give men an extraordinary, and supernaturall grace to follow that Precept.,
Hee seeth every high thing below him; and is King of all the children of pride.",
Want Of Absolute Power  Of which, this is one, "That a man to obtain a Kingdome, is sometimes content with lesse Power, than to the Peace, and defence of the Common-wealth is necessarily required.",
Private Judgement Of Good and Evill  In the second place, I observe the Diseases of a Common-wealth, that proceed from the poyson of seditious doctrines; whereof one is, "That every private man is Judge of Good and Evill actions.",
Erroneous Conscience  Another doctrine repugnant to Civill Society, is, that "Whatsoever a man does against his Conscience, is Sinne;" and it dependeth on the presumption of making himself judge of Good and Evill.,
Faith, and Sanctity, are indeed not very frequent; but yet they are not Miracles, but brought to passe by education, discipline, correction, and other naturall wayes, by which God worketh them in his elect, as such time as he thinketh fit.,
Subjecting The Soveraign Power To Civill Lawes  A fourth opinion, repugnant to the nature of a Common-wealth, is this, "That he that hath the Soveraign Power, is subject to the Civill Lawes.",
Attributing Of Absolute Propriety To The Subjects  A Fifth doctrine, that tendeth to the Dissolution of a Common-wealth, is, "That every private man has an absolute Propriety in his Goods; such, as excludeth the Right of the Soveraign.",
Dividing Of The Soveraign Power  There is a Sixth doctrine, plainly, and directly against the essence of a Common-wealth; and ’tis this, "That the Soveraign Power may be divided.",
In the Kingdome of God, there may be three Persons independent, without breach of unity in God that Reigneth; but where men Reigne, that be subject to diversity of opinions, it cannot be so.,
Therefore the People are to be taught, to abstain from violence to one anothers person, by private revenges; from violation of conjugall honour; and from forcibly rapine, and fraudulent surreption of one anothers goods.,
But what is a good Law?,
Unnecessary Lawes are not good Lawes; but trapps for Mony: which where the right of Soveraign Power is acknowledged, are superfluous; and where it is not acknowledged, unsufficient to defend the People.,
And again, "God is King though the Nations be angry; and he that sitteth on the Cherubins, though the earth be moved.",
From hence there ariseth a triple Word of God, Rational, Sensible, and Prophetique: to which Correspondeth a triple Hearing; Right Reason, Sense Supernaturall, and Faith.,
As for Sense Supernaturall, which consisteth in Revelation, or Inspiration, there have not been any Universall Lawes so given, because God speaketh not in that manner, but to particular persons, and to divers men divers things.,
"How Good," saith David, "is the God of Israel to those that are Upright in Heart; and yet my feet were almost gone, my treadings had well-nigh slipt; for I was grieved at the Wicked, when I saw the Ungodly in such Prosperity.",
And Job, how earnestly does he expostulate with God, for the many Afflictions he suffered, notwithstanding his Righteousnesse?,
Conformable to this doctrine is the sentence of our Saviour, concerning the man that was born Blind, in these words, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his fathers; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.",
Worship Naturall And Arbitrary  There be some signes of Honour, (both in Attributes and Actions,) that be Naturally so; as amongst Attributes, Good, Just, Liberall, and the like; and amongst Actions, Prayers, Thanks, and Obedience.,
Fourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) Ease to God, take from him the care of Mankind; take from him his Honour: for it takes away mens love, and fear of him; which is the root of Honour.,
Fifthly, in those things that signifie Greatnesse, and Power; to say he is Finite, is not to Honour him: For it is not a signe of the Will to Honour God, to attribute to him lesse than we can; and Finite, is lesse,

444/1304=0.34049079754601225

Fourthly, Not to swear by any but God, is naturally a signe of Honour: for it is a confession that God onely knoweth the heart; and that no mans wit, or strength can protect a man against Gods vengence on the perjured.,
Seventhly, Reason directeth not onely to worship God in Secret; but also, and especially, in Publique, and in the sight of men: For without that, (that which in honour is most acceptable) the procuring others to honour him, is lost.,
For seeing Punishments are consequent to the breach of Lawes; Naturall Punishments must be naturally consequent to the breach of the Lawes of Nature; and therfore follow them as their naturall, not arbitrary effects.,
For Sense, Memory, Understanding, Reason, and Opinion are not in our power to change; but alwaies, and necessarily such, as the things we see, hear, and consider suggest unto us; and therefore are not effects of our Will, but our Will of them.,
How God speaketh to a man immediately, may be understood by those well enough, to whom he hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood by another, is hard, if not impossible to know.,
It is true, that if he be my Soveraign, he may oblige me to obedience, so, as not by act or word to declare I beleeve him not; but not to think any otherwise then my reason perswades me.,
By What Marks Prophets Are Known  How then can he, to whom God hath never revealed his Wil immediately (saving by the way of natural reason) know when he is to obey, or not to obey his Word, delivered by him, that sayes he is a Prophet?,
If one Prophet deceive another, what certainty is there of knowing the will of God, by other way than that of Reason?,
For these words, "revolt from the Lord your God," are in this place equivalent to "revolt from your King.",
"There shall arise," (saith he) "false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall doe great wonders and miracles, even to the seducing (if it were possible) of the very Elect.",
St. Paul says further to the Galatians, that "if himself, or an Angell from heaven preach another Gospel to them, than he had preached, let him be accursed.",
"If thou say in thy heart, How shall we know that the Word (of the Prophet) is not that which the Lord hath spoken.,
When the Prophet shall have spoken in the name of the Lord, that which shall not come to passe, that’s the word which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet has spoken it out of the pride of his own heart, fear him not.",
But a man may here again ask, When the Prophet hath foretold a thing, how shal we know whether it will come to passe or not?,
And this Scripture is it, out of which I am to take the Principles of my Discourse, concerning the Rights of those that are the Supream Govenors on earth, of Christian Common-wealths; and of the duty of Christian Subjects towards their Soveraigns.,
And because all Rules of life, which men are in conscience bound to observe, are Laws; the question of the Scripture, is the question of what is Law throughout all Christendome, both Naturall, and Civill.,
But it may perhaps be alledged, that the last Chapter only, not the whole Pentateuch, was written by some other man, but the rest not: Let us therefore consider that which we find in the Book of Genesis, Chap.,
And this is that Law which God commanded, that their Kings (when they should have established that form of Government) should take a copy of from the Priests and Levites to lay in the side of the Arke; (Deut.,
9) of which the Writer saith thus, "They are there unto this day;" (Josh 5.,
30. where it is said, that Jonathan "and his sonnes were Priests to the Tribe of Dan, untill the day of the captivity of the land.",
& 30.25. where, after David had adjudged equall part of the spoiles, to them that guarded the Ammunition, with them that fought, the Writer saith, "He made it a Statute and an Ordinance to Israel to this day.",
6.4.),
Job  The Book of Job hath no mark in it of the time wherein it was written: and though it appear sufficiently (Exekiel 14.14, and James 5.11.),
14. verse 21, 22, &c. where speaking to God, he saith thus, "Thy law is burnt; therefore no man knoweth the things which thou has done, or the works that are to begin.,
And this diversity of Seeming, (produced by the diversity of the operation of bodies, on the organs of our sense) we attribute to alterations of the Bodies that operate, & call them Accidents of those Bodies.,
"The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters.",
For Joseph having advised him to look out a wise and discreet man, and to set him over the land of Egypt, he saith thus, "Can we find such a man as this is, in whom is the Spirit of God?",
"Thou shalt speak (saith God) to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the Spirit of Wisdome, to make Aaron Garments, to consecrate him.",
And Isaiah 11.2,3. where the Prophet speaking of the Messiah, saith, "The Spirit of the Lord shall abide upon him, the Spirit of wisdome and understanding, the Spirit of counsell, and fortitude; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.",
And of Saul, upon the newes of the insolence of the Ammonites towards the men of Jabeth Gilead, it is said (1 Sam.11.6.),
that "The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and his Anger (or, as it is in the Latine, His Fury) was kindled greatly.",
In like manner by the Spirit of God, that came upon Saul, when hee was amongst the Prophets that praised God in Songs, and Musick (1 Sam.19.20.),
Fourthly, For The Gift Of Prediction By Dreams And Visions  The false Prophet Zedekiah, saith to Micaiah (1 Kings 22.24.),
"Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee?",
It is said, "God made man of the dust of the Earth, and breathed into his nostrills (spiraculum vitae) the breath of life, and man was made a living soul.",
There the Breath of Life inspired by God, signifies no more, but that God gave him life; And (Job 27.3.),
"as long as the Spirit of God is in my nostrils;" is no more then to say, "as long as I live.",
"the Spirit of life was in the wheels," is equivalent to, "the wheels were alive.",
"the spirit entred into me, and set me on my feet," that is, "I recovered my vitall strength;" not that any Ghost, or incorporeal substance entred into, and possessed his body.,
34.9.),
"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his:" not meaning thereby the Ghost of Christ, but a Submission to his Doctrine.,
As also (1 John 4.2.),
For we read Gen. 16. that the same apparition is called, not onely an Angel, but God; where that which (verse 7.),
18.),
as but one, and that one, as God, (for the words are, "Lot said unto them, Oh not so my Lord") be understood of images of men, supernaturally formed in the Fancy; as well as before by Angel was understood a fancyed Voice?,
22.11.),
where Jacob saith thus, "The Angel of the Lord appeared to mee in my sleep.",
For an apparition made to a man in his sleep, is that which all men call a Dreame, whether such Dreame be naturall, or supernaturall: and that which there Jacob calleth an Angel, was God himselfe; for the same Angel saith (verse 13.),
"I am the God of Bethel.",
Also (Exod.14.9.),
the Angel that went before the Army of Israel to the Red Sea, and then came behind it, is (verse 19.),
the Lord himself; and he appeared not in the form of a beautifull man, but in form (by day) of a Pillar Of Cloud and (by night) in form of a Pillar Of Fire; and yet this Pillar was all the apparition, and Angel promised to Moses (Exod.,
33.14.),
had desired God to goe along with the Campe, (as he had done alwaies before the making of the Golden Calfe,) God did not answer, "I will goe," nor "I will send an Angel in my stead;" but thus, "my presence shall goe with thee.",
6.3.),
"Knew ye not that wee shall judge the Angels?",
2.4.),
"For if God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down into Hell.",
In the resurrection men doe neither marry, nor give in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven:" but in the resurrection men shall be Permanent, and not Incorporeall; so therefore also are the Angels.,
2.7.),
For we are not to think that God made first a living breath, and then blew it into Adam after he was made, whether that breath were reall, or seeming; but only as it is (Acts 17.25.),
3.16.),
1.21.),
So likewise where God sayes (Joel 2.28.),
The Originall Of The Kingdome Of God  After this, it pleased God to speak to Abraham, and (Gen.,
17.7,8.),
And for a memoriall, and a token of this Covenant, he ordaineth (verse 11.),
4.11.),
That The Kingdome Of God Is Properly His Civill Soveraignty Over A Peculiar People By Pact  This Covenant, at the Foot of Mount Sinai, was renewed by Moses (Exod.,
2.14.),
The same is again confirmed in expresse words in the same Text, "Yee shall be to me a Sacerdotall Kingdome, and an holy Nation.",
12.12.),
And after the Israelites had rejected God, the Prophets did foretell his restitution; as (Isaiah 24.23.),
"Then the Moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;" where he speaketh expressely of his Reign in Zion, and Jerusalem; that is, on Earth.,
And (Micah 4.7.),
"As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and a stretched out arme, and with fury powred out, I wil rule over you; and (verse 37.),
19.6.),
"a Holy Nation.",
In saying "Hallowed be thy name," we do but pray to God for grace to keep the first Commandement, of "having no other Gods but Him.",
The whole Nation of the Israelites were a people Holy to God; yet the tribe of Levi was amongst the Israelites a Holy tribe; and amongst the Levites, the Priests were yet more Holy; and amongst the Priests, the High Priest was the most Holy.,
So the Land of Judea was the Holy Land; but the Holy City wherein God was to be worshipped, was more Holy; and again, the Temples more Holy than the City; and the Sanctum Sanctorum more Holy than the rest of the Temple.,
"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you, but seeing you put it from you, and judge your selves unworthy of everlasting life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles.",
the Word of God, is called the Word of the Gospel, because it containeth the Doctrine of the Kingdome of Christ; and the same Word (Rom.,
10.8,9.),
19.),
"When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdome;" that is, the Doctrine of the Kingdome taught by Christ.,
24.),
4.1.),
For example, though these words, "I am the Lord thy God, &c." to the end of the Ten Commandements, were spoken by God to Moses; yet the Preface, "God spake these words and said," is to be understood for the Words of him that wrote the holy History.,
Properly, as the words, he hath spoken to his Prophets; Metaphorically, for his Wisdome, Power, and eternall Decree, in making the world; in which sense, those Fiats, "Let there be light," "Let there be a firmament," "Let us make man," &c. (Gen.,
1.),
And in the same sense it is said (John 1.3.),
"All things were made by it, and without it was nothing made that was made; And (Heb.,
1.3.),
"He upholdeth all things by the word of his Power;" that is, by the Power of his Word; that is, by his Power; and (Heb.,
11.3.),
Secondly, For The Effect Of His Word  Secondly, for the effect of his Word; that is to say, for the thing it self, which by his Word is Affirmed, Commanded, Threatned, or Promised; as (Psalm 105.19.),
where Joseph is said to have been kept in prison, "till his Word was come;" that is, till that was come to passe which he had (Gen.,
18.36.),
Elijah saith to God, "I have done all these thy Words," in stead of "I have done all these things at thy Word," or commandement: and (Jer.,
17.15.),
"Where is the Word of the Lord," is put for, "Where is the Evill he threatened:" And (Ezek.,
And in this sense it is, that St. John the Evangelist, and, I think, St. John onely calleth our Saviour himself as in the flesh "the Word of God (as Joh.,
1.14.),
And this Word which St. John in his Gospel saith was with God, is (in his 1 Epistle, verse 1.),
called "the Word of Life;" and (verse 2.),
"The eternall life, which was with the Father:" so that he can be in no other sense called the Word, then in that, wherein he is called Eternall life; that is, "he that hath procured us Eternall life," by his comming in the flesh.,
So also (Apocalypse 19.13.),
Thirdly, For The Words Of Reason And Equity  There are also places of the Scripture, where, by the Word of God, is signified such Words as are consonant to reason, and equity, though spoken sometimes neither by prophet, nor by a holy man.,
that "He spake not this of himselfe, but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that one man should dye for the nation.",
Also they that in Christian Congregations taught the people, (1 Cor.,
14.3.),
4.16.),
concerning Aaron, "He shall be thy Spokes-man to the People; and he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in stead of God;" that which here is Spokesman, is (chap.7.1.),
interpreted Prophet; "See (saith God) I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy Prophet.",
10.5,6.),
10.),
11.4,5.),
1.12.),
10.),
in these words, "And the Evill spirit came upon Saul, and he Prophecyed in the midst of the house.",
Can it (may some say) be properly said, that God hath voice and language, when it cannot be properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a man?,
The Prophet David argueth thus, "Shall he that made the eye, not see?,
or he that made the ear, not hear?",
15.1.),
1.),
3.),
1.),
17.),
11.),
24.),
12.),
in a dream; that is to say (as are the words of the text) "Jacob dreamed that he saw a ladder, &c." And (Gen. 32.,
1.),
3.2.),
6,7,8.),
"If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my self known to him in a Vision, and will speak unto him in a Dream.,
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all my house; with him I will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold.",
11.),
"The Lord spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend.",
And yet this speaking of God to Moses, was by mediation of an Angel, or Angels, as appears expressely, Acts 7. ver.,
And conformable hereunto, where God saith (Deut.,
1.),
28.),
"Your sons and your daughters shall Prophecy; your old men shall dream Dreams, and your young men shall see Visions:" where again, the word Prophecy is expounded by Dream, and Vision.,
And in the same manner it was, that God spake to Solomon, promising him Wisdome, Riches, and Honor; for the text saith, (1 Kings 3.,
15.),
12.),
where the Prophet speaking of the Jewes, saith, "They made their hearths hard as Adamant, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his Spirit by the former Prophets.",
9.),
18.),
19.),
2.),
whether he should fight against the Philistines at Keilah; and (verse 10.),
27.),
took the Priesthood from Abiathar, and gave it (verse 35.),
To say he spake by Inspiration, or Infusion of the Holy Spirit, as the Holy Spirit signifieth the Deity, is to make Moses equall with Christ, in whom onely the Godhead (as St. Paul speaketh Col.,
For God disposeth men to Piety, Justice, Mercy, Truth, Faith, and all manner of Vertue, both Morall, and Intellectuall, by doctrine, example, and by severall occasions, naturall, and ordinary.,
"The Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto Moses, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy Elders.,
For there was (verse 27.),
For if it were meant they had the substantial Spirit of God; that is, the Divine nature, inspired into them, then they had it in no lesse manner than Christ himself, in whom onely the Spirit of God dwelt bodily.,
And it appeareth (verse 16.),
18.),
13, 14.),
43.),
10.),
God divided the land of Canaan amongst the Israelite, by the "lots that Joshua did cast before the Lord in Shiloh.",
And first, that there were many more false than true Prophets, appears by this, that when Ahab (1 Kings 12.),
14. verse 14.),
I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor spake unto them, they prophecy to you a false Vision, a thing of naught; and the deceit of their heart.",
16.),
"Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, hearken not unto the words of the Prophets, that prophecy to you.,
They make you vain, they speak a Vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.",
14.14.),
2, &c) speaking expressely of the means to examine Spirits, whether they be of God, or not; after he hath told them that there would arise false Prophets, saith thus, "Hereby know ye the Spirit of God.,
Again in the next verse, "Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not of Christ.,
And this is the Spirit of Antichrist.",
But when wee see some possible, naturall cause of it, how rarely soever the like has been done; or if the like have been often done, how impossible soever it be to imagine a naturall means thereof, we no more wonder, nor esteem it for a Miracle.,
And when hee had done these Miracles before the people, it is said (verse 41.),
that "they beleeved him.",
58.),
that he wrought not many Miracles in his own countrey, because of their unbeleef; and (in Marke 6.5.),
in stead of, "he wrought not many," it is, "he could work none.",
11.),
"the Magicians of Egypt did the like by their Enchantments;" and that after Moses had turned the waters of the Egyptian Streams, Rivers, Ponds, and Pooles of water into blood, (Exod.,
22.),
"the Magicians of Egypt did so likewise, with their Enchantments;" and that after Moses had by the power of God brought frogs upon the land, (Exod.,
7.),
What opinion of miraculous power, before it was known there was a Science of the course of the Stars, might a man have gained, that should have told the people, This hour, or day the Sun should be darkned?,
If he say not, then followeth that which Moses saith, (Deut.,
22.),
"he hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not fear him.",
And therefore as soon as he had eaten of it, God thrust him out of Paradise, "lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and live for ever.",
22.),
5.18, 19.),
"As by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men to Justification of Life.",
15.21,22) more perspicuously delivered in these words, "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.,
For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.",
For if as in Adam, all die, that is, have forfeited Paradise, and Eternall Life on Earth; even so in Christ all shall be made alive; then all men shall be made to live on Earth; for else the comparison were not proper.,
133.3.),
"Upon Zion God commanded the blessing, even Life for evermore;" for Zion, is in Jerusalem, upon Earth: as also that of S. Joh.,
2.7.),
"To him that overcommeth I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.",
21.2.),
And this differs nothing from that, which the two men in white clothing (that is, the two Angels) said to the Apostles, that were looking upon Christ ascending (Acts 1.11.),
"This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him go up into Heaven.",
"that in the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven," is a description of an Eternall Life, resembling that which we lost in Adam in the point of Marriage.,
3.13.),
that "no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, that is in Heaven.",
16.10.),
"Thou wilt not leave my soule in Hell, nor suffer thine Holy one to see corruption," saith, they were spoken (not of David, but) of Christ; and to prove it, addeth this Reason, "For David is not ascended into Heaven.",
For he is not a God of the Dead, but of the Living; for they all live to him.",
"There is hope of a tree," (saith hee verse 7.),
"if it be cast down, Though the root thereof wax old, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet when it scenteth the water it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a Plant.,
But man dyeth, and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?",
"man lyeth down, and riseth not, till the heavens be no more.",
But when is it, that the heavens shall be no more?,
Chapter, and 7. verse, he saith, that "the Heavens and the Earth that are now, are reserved unto fire against the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men," and (verse 12.),
"looking for, and hasting to the comming of God, wherein the Heavens shall be on fire, and shall be dissolved, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat.,
Neverthelesse, we according to the promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse.",
For St. Peter saies not, "Wee look for new heavens, and a new earth, (from Nature) but from Promise.",
"The man that wandreth out of the way of understanding, shall remain in the congregation of the Giants," and Job 26.5.,
"Behold the Giants groan under water, and they that dwell with them.",
"But the timorous, incredulous, and abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolators, and all Lyars, shall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire, and Brimstone; which is the second Death.",
"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth, shall awake; some to Everlasting life; and some to shame, and everlasting contempt.",
15.42, 43.),
13,14.),
"For after Death, and the Grave shall have delivered up the dead which were in them, and every man be judged according to his works; Death and the Grave shall also be cast into the Lake of Fire.,
This is the Second Death.",
And therefore in the Holy Scripture, Remission of Sinne, and Salvation from Death and Misery, is the same thing, as it appears by the words of our Saviour, who having cured a man sick of the Palsey, by saying, (Mat.,
9.2.),
"Son be of good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee;" and knowing that the Scribes took for blasphemy, that a man should pretend to forgive Sins, asked them (v.5.),
"as the Lord liveth that saveth Israel," that is, from their temporary enemies, and 2 Sam.,
"Thou art my Saviour, thou savest me from violence;" and 2 Kings 13.5.,
"God gave the Israelites a Saviour, and so they were delivered from the hand of the Assyrians," and the like, I need say nothing; there being neither difficulty, nor interest, to corrupt the interpretation of texts of that kind.,
"Look upon Zion, the City of our solemnities, thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.,
And the Inhabitant shall not say, I am sicke; the people that shall dwell therein shall be forgiven their Iniquity.",
The condition of the Saved, "The Inhabitants shall not say, I am sick:" And lastly, all this is comprehended in Forgivenesse of sin, "The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.",
And therefore also the woman not impertinently answered him again, "We know the Messias shall come.",
So that which our saviour saith, "Salvation is from the Jews," is the same that Paul sayes (Rom.,
1.16,17.),
"The Gospel is the power of God to Salvation to every one that beleeveth; To the Jew first, and also to the Greek.,
For therein is the righteousnesse of God revealed from faith to faith;" from the faith of the Jew, to the faith of the Gentile.,
For in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem shall be Salvation.",
"If God spared not the Old World, but saved Noah the eighth person, a Preacher of righteousnesse, bringing the flood upon the world of the ungodly," &c. So the First World, was from Adam to the generall Flood.,
Of the present World, our Saviour speaks (John 18.36.),
"My Kingdome is not of this World.",
13.),
"Neverthelesse we according to his promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth.",
Sometimes (though not often) it is taken for Gods House, that is to say, for a Temple, wherein Christians assemble to perform holy duties publiquely; as, 1 Cor.,
"Let your women keep silence in the Churches:" but this is Metaphorically put, for the Congregation there assembled; and hath been since used for the Edifice it self, to distinguish between the Temples of Christians, and Idolaters.,
And when they were called forth by lawfull Authority, (Acts 19.39.),
It is taken also sometimes for the men that have right to be of the Congregation, though not actually assembled; that is to say, for the whole multitude of Christian men, how far soever they be dispersed: as (Act.,
8.3.),
"Salute the Church that is in his house.",
"A Glorious Church, without spot, or wrinkle, holy, and without blemish;" which is meant of the Church Triumphant, or, Church To Come.,
18.17. where it is said, "Tell it to the Church, and if hee neglect to hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Gentile, or Publican.",
According to this sense, I define a CHURCH to be, "A company of men professing Christian Religion, united in the person of one Soveraign; at whose command they ought to assemble, and without whose authority they ought not to assemble.",
According whereunto (Gen 18.18, 19.),
God saith, "All the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him, For I know him that he will command his children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.",
35.),
For it could not be the commandement of God that could oblige them; because God spake not to them immediately, but by the mediation of Moses Himself; And our Saviour saith of himself, (John 5.,
31.),
"If I bear witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true," much lesse if Moses bear witnesse of himselfe, (especially in a claim of Kingly power over Gods people) ought his testimony to be received.,
20.18.),
"when they saw the Thunderings, and the Lightnings, and the noyse of the Trumpet, and the mountaine smoaking, removed, and stood a far off.,
And they said unto Moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with us lest we die.",
24.1, 2.),
And Moses alone shall come neer the Lord, but they shall not come nigh, neither shall the people goe up with him.",
And though afterwards it be said (verse 9.),
Lastly, the question of the Authority of Aaron, by occasion of his and Miriams mutiny against Moses, was (Numbers 12.),
12.),
"to the people round about, and say, Take heed to your selves that you goe not up into the Mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the Mount shall surely be put to death.",
"Get down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze.",
"Gather to mee Seventy of the Elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the Elders of the People.",
To these God imparted his Spirit; but it was not a different Spirit from that of Moses; for it is said (verse 25.),
"God came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit that was upon Moses, and gave it to the Seventy Elders.",
36.),
The Supreme Power of Judicature belonged also to the High Priest: For the Book of the Law was in their keeping; and the Priests and Levites onely were the subordinate Judges in causes Civill, as appears in Deut.,
Therefore the Civill and Ecclesiasticall Power were both joined together in one and the same person, the High Priest; and ought to bee so, in whosoever governeth by Divine Right; that is, by Authority immediate from God.,
For after the death of Joshua, & Eleazar, "there arose another generation" (Judges 2.10.),
"that knew not the Lord, nor the works which he had done for Israel, but did evill in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim.",
And yet God consented to it, saying to Samuel (verse 7.),
"Hearken unto the voice of the People, in all that they shall say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected mee, that I should not reign over them.",
Having therefore rejected God, in whose Right the Priests governed, there was no authority left to the Priests, but such as the King was pleased to allow them; which was more, or lesse, according as the Kings were good, or evill.,
Besides, we read (1 Kings 2.27.),
And we read also (1 Kings 8.),
that David made Hashabiah and his brethren, Hebronites, Officers of Israel among them Westward, "in all businesse of the Lord, and in the service of the King.",
Likewise (verse 32.),
that hee made other Hebronites, "rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of Manasseh" (these were the rest of Israel that dwelt beyond Jordan) "for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the King.",
Is not this full Power, both Temporall and Spirituall, as they call it, that would divide it?,
And generally through the whole History of the Kings, as well of Judah, as of Israel, there were Prophets that alwaies controlled the Kings, for transgressing the Religion; and sometimes also for Errours of State; (2 Chro.,
2.),
In the old Law (as we may read, Leviticus the 16.),
Our Saviour Christs sufferings seem to be here figured, as cleerly, as in the oblation of Isaac, or in any other type of him in the Old Testament: He was both the sacrificed Goat, and the Scape Goat; "Hee was oppressed, and he was afflicted (Isa.,
"He hath born our Griefs, (ver.4.),
and carried our sorrows;" And again, (ver.,
6.),
"the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all:" And so he is the Scape Goat.,
"He was cut off from the land of the living (ver.,
8.),
11.),
According whereunto, our Saviour himself expressely saith, (John 18.36.),
"My Kingdome is not of this world.",
And that is it which our Saviour saith, (Mat.,
"The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.",
23.2.),
"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat; All therefore whatsoever they bid you doe, that observe and doe;" hee declareth plainly, that hee ascribeth Kingly Power, for that time, not to himselfe, but to them.,
And so hee hath also, where he saith, (Luke 12.14.),
"Who made mee a Judge, or Divider over you?",
"I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.",
22.),
"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.",
And this is not repugnant to that other place, "I came not to judge the world:" for this is spoken of the world present, the other of the world to come; as also where it is said, that at the second coming of Christ, (Mat.,
28.),
"Yee that have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his Glory, yee shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
And therefore it is, that our Saviour saith (Mat.,
that his Apostles should sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, "When the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory;" whereby he signified that he should reign then in his humane nature; and (Mat.,
"The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he shall reward every man according to his works.",
"I appoint unto you a Kingdome, as my Father hath appointed to mee, that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdome, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
But a man may here ask, seeing there is no marriage in the Kingdome of Heaven, whether men shall then eat, and drink; what eating therefore is meant in this place?,
This is expounded by our Saviour (John 6.27.),
where he saith, "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give you.",
For it is one of the Prophecies concerning Christ, that he should be like (in Office) to Moses; "I will raise them up a Prophet (saith the Lord, Deut.,
18.18.),
from amongst their Brethren like unto thee, and will put my words into his mouth," and this similitude with Moses, is also apparent in the actions of our Saviour himself, whilest he was conversant on Earth.,
"Forbid him not, for hee that is not against us, is on our part.",
"then commeth the end, when hee shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father;" and by many other most expresse places.,
"And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of Wisdome; for Moses had laid his hands upon him.",
Our Saviour therefore between his Resurrection, and Ascension, gave his Spirit to the Apostles; first, by "Breathing on them, and saying," (John 20.22.),
"Receive yee the Holy Spirit;" and after his Ascension (Acts 2.2, 3.),
16.].),
St. John therefore tells us (verse 11.),
that they bear witnesse, that "God hath given us eternall life in his Son.",
And as for the Apostles, it was the character of the Apostleship, in the twelve first and great Apostles, to bear Witnesse of his Resurrection; as appeareth expressely (Acts 1. ver.,
8.),
"He that beleeveth on the Son of man hath the Witnesse in himselfe.",
For if the Supreme King, have not his Regall Power in this world; by what authority can obedience be required to his Officers?,
"You that have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you shall also sit upon twelve Thrones;" And of St. Paul (Ephes.,
"Having your feet shod with the Preparation of the Gospell of Peace.",
1.24.),
"Wee have no Dominion over your Faith, but are Helpers of your Joy.",
"Children obey your Parents in all things; for this is well pleasing to the Lord.",
13. the first 6. verses) exhorting to "be subject to the Higher Powers," he saith, "that all Power is ordained of God;" and "that we ought to be subject to them, not onely for" fear of incurring their "wrath, but also for conscience sake.",
13, 14, 15.),
3.1.),
"Put men in mind to be subject to Principalities, and Powers, and to obey Magistrates.",
How then can wee be obliged to doe any thing contrary to the Command of the King, or other Soveraign Representant of the Common-wealth, whereof we are members, and by whom we look to be protected?,
What Christians May Do To Avoid Persecution  But what (may some object) if a King, or a Senate, or other Soveraign Person forbid us to beleeve in Christ?,
And if it be further asked, What if wee bee commanded by our lawfull Prince, to say with our tongue, wee beleeve not; must we obey such command?,
Naaman was converted in his heart to the God of Israel; For hee saith (2 Kings 5.17.),
This the Prophet approved, and bid him "Goe in peace.",
But then what shall we answer to our Saviours saying, "Whosoever denyeth me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in Heaven?",
Of Martyrs  But what then shall we say of all those Martyrs we read of in the History of the Church, that they have needlessely cast away their lives?,
10.),
that the twelve Apostles were sent "to the lost sheep of the house of Israel," and commanded to Preach, "that the Kingdome of God was at hand.",
the seventy Disciples are sent out, "as Labourers, not as Lords of the Harvest;" and are bidden (verse 9.),
to say, "The Kingdome of God is come nigh unto you;" and by Kingdome here is meant, not the Kingdome of Grace, but the Kingdome of Glory; for they are bidden to denounce it (ver.,
11.),
Preachers therefore have not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall power: "Bee not called Masters, (saith our Saviour, Mat.,
23.10) for one is your Master, even Christ.",
28.19. or as in St. Mark 16.15 "Goe into all the world, and Preach the Gospel to every creature.",
To Baptize;  Another point of their Commission, is to Baptize, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.",
This, being our promise in Baptisme; and the Authority of Earthly Soveraigns being not to be put down till the day of Judgment; (for that is expressely affirmed by S. Paul 1 Cor.,
And therefore after our Saviour had breathed upon them, saying, (John 20.22.),
"Receive the Holy Ghost," hee addeth in the next verse, "Whose soever Sins ye Remit, they are Remitted unto them; and whose soever Sins ye Retain, they are Retained.",
Therefore the Apostles, and their Successors, are to follow but the outward marks of Repentance; which appearing, they have no Authority to deny Absolution; and if they appeare not, they have no authority to Absolve.,
And this question is decided by our Saviour himself; (Mat.,
15, 16, 17.),
"If thy Brother (saith he) shall trespasse against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee, and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother.,
And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican.",
And comformable hereunto was the practise of St. Paul (1 Cor.,
5.3, 4, & 5.),
11, 12.),
the Judgment in such a case is more expressely attributed to the Assembly: "But now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, &c. with such a one no not to eat.,
Do not ye judg them that are within?",
It was not enough to repute them as Heathen, that never had been Christians; for with such they might eate, and drink; which with Excommunicate persons they might not do; as appeareth by the words of St. Paul, (1 Cor.,
18.17.),
"Let him be to thee as a Heathen, and as a Publican.",
For What Fault Lyeth Excommunication  There Lyeth Excommunication for Injustice; as (Mat.,
18.),
If thy Brother offend thee, tell it him privately; then with Witnesses; lastly, tell the Church; and then if he obey not, "Let him be to thee as an Heathen man, and a Publican.",
And there lyeth Excommunication for a Scandalous Life, as (1 Cor.,
11.),
"If any man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one yee are not to eat.",
"A man that is an Haeretique, after the first and second admonition, reject.",
For an Haeretique, is he, that being a member of the Church, teacheth neverthelesse some private opinion, which the Church has forbidden: and such a one, S. Paul adviseth Titus, after the first, and second admonition, to Reject.,
"Foolish and unlearned questions avoid;" The word Avoid in this place, and Reject in the former, is the same in the Originall, paraitou: but Foolish questions may bee set by without Excommunication.,
2.11.),
For if he beleeve that "Jesus is the Christ, he hath the Spirit of God" (1 Joh.,
4.1.),
"and God dwelleth in him, and he in God," (1 Joh.,
8.),
"They have not rejected thee, but mee.",
Of The Interpreter Of The Scriptures Before Civill Soveraigns Became Christians  St. Paul coming to Thessalonica, where was a Synagogue of the Jews, (Acts 17.2, 3.),
"As his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, Opening and alledging, that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus whom he preached was the Christ.",
Hereupon (as it is verse 4.),
What was the reason, when they all beleeved the Scripture, that they did not all beleeve alike; but that some approved, others disapproved the Interpretation of St. Paul that cited them; and every one Interpreted them to himself?,
If these Jews of Thessalonica were not, who else was the Judge of what S. Paul alledged out of Scripture?,
And as to the case of the Jews in particular, they were bound by expresse words (Deut.,
17.),
39.),
"Search the Scriptures; for in them yee thinke to have eternall life, and they are they that testifie of me.",
And as it was in the Apostles time, it must be till such time as there should be Pastors, that could authorise an Interpreter, whose Interpretation should generally be stood to: But that could not be till Kings were Pastors, or Pastors Kings.,
Of The Power To Make Scripture Law  There be two senses, wherein a Writing may be said to be Canonicall; for Canon, signifieth a Rule; and a Rule is a Precept, by which a man is guided, and directed in any action whatsoever.,
"Speak them thou to us, and we will hear thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we die.",
29.1.),
"The words of a Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Children of Israel, besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb.",
27.1.),
they were commanded to write upon great stones playstered over, at their passing over Jordan: This Law also was written by Moses himself in a Book; and delivered into the hands of the "Priests, and to the Elders of Israel," (Deut.,
31.9.),
26.),
"to be put in the side of the Arke;" for in the Ark it selfe was nothing but the Ten Commandements.,
This was the Law, which Moses (Deuteronomy 17.18.),
"Thy Law is burnt; therefor no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, of the works that shall begin.",
And before the Captivity, between the time when the Law was lost, (which is not mentioned in the Scripture, but may probably be thought to be the time of Rehoboam, when Shishak King of Egypt took the spoils of the Temple,(1 Kings 14.26.)),
5.),
"Ho, every man that thirsteth, come yee to the waters, come, and buy wine and milke without money.",
For first, the Apostles power was no other than that of our Saviour, to invite men to embrace the Kingdome of God; which they themselves acknowledged for a Kingdome (not present, but) to come; and they that have no Kingdome, can make no Laws.,
And therefore of Infidels, S. John saith not, the wrath of God shall "come" upon them, but "the wrath of God remaineth upon them;" and not that they shall be condemned; but that "they are condemned already.,
"(John 3.36, 3.18) Nor can it be conceived, that the benefit of Faith, "is Remission of sins" unlesse we conceive withall, that the dammage of Infidelity, is "the Retention of the same sins.",
59. which forbids the reading of other Books then those in the Churches; which is a Mandate that is not addressed to every Christian, but to those onely that had authority to read any publiquely in the Church; that is, to Ecclesiastiques onely.,
And therefore at the election of a new Apostle in the place of Judas Iscariot, S. Peter saith (Acts 1.21,22.),
The first Apostle, of those which were not constituted by Christ in the time he was upon the Earth, was Matthias, chosen in this manner: There were assembled together in Jerusalem about 120 Christians (Acts 1.15.),
23.),
and caused lots to be drawn; "and (ver.,
26.),
the Lot fell on Matthias and he was numbred with the Apostles.",
Paul And Barnabas Made Apostles By The Church Of Antioch  After him there was never any other Apostle ordained, but Paul and Barnabas, which was done (as we read Acts 13.1,2,3.),
"There were in the Church that was at Antioch, certaine Prophets, and Teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen; which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.,
As they ministred unto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, ‘Separate mee Barnabas, and Saul for the worke whereunto I have called them.’ And when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.",
And that this their calling was to the Apostleship, is apparent by that, that they are both called (Acts 14.14.),
Apostles: And that it was by vertue of this act of the Church of Antioch, that they were Apostles, S. Paul declareth plainly (Rom.,
1.1.),
And so the Apostles were the first Christian Bishops, instituted by Christ himselfe: in which sense the Apostleship of Judas is called (Acts 1.20.),
Nay S. John himselfe, the Apostle beloved of our Lord, beginneth his Second Epistle with these words, "The Elder to the Elect Lady.",
For the words there are, "cheirotonesantes autoispresbuterous kat ekklesian," that is, "When they had Ordained them Elders by the Holding up of Hands in every Congregation.",
And (because all the Churches had their Presbyters ordained in the same manner,) where the word is Constitute, (as Titus 1.5.),
For the Pastors of the Church, called (Acts 6.4.),
5.),
For it is manifest (verse 1.),
that when Philip preached in Samaria, the Apostles were at Jerusalem, and (verse 14.),
"When they heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, sent Peter and John to them;" by imposition of whose hands, they that were Baptized (verse 15.),
16.17.),

"Brethren looke you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and of Wisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse.",
20.),
"Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part amongst them, I am thy part, and thine inheritance amongst the Children of Israel.",
9,10.),
By which it is probable, their ordinary maintenance was not unsuitable to their employment; for their employment was (ver.,
8.),
2,3.),
34.),
upon the mony which was made of the sale of their lands and possessions, and laid down at the feet of the Apostles, of good will, not of duty; for "whilest the Land remained (saith S. Peter to Ananias Acts 5.4.),
and after it was sold, was it not in thy power?",
The Ministers Of The Gospel Lived On The Benevolence Of Their Flocks But here may some ask, whether the Pastor were then bound to live upon voluntary contribution, as upon almes, "For who (saith S. Paul 1 Cor.,
7.),
or who feedeth a flock, and eatheth not of the milke of the flock?",
13.),
"Doe ye not know that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at the Altar, partake with the Altar;" that is to say, have part of that which is offered at the Altar for their maintenance?,
And then he concludeth, "Even so hath the Lord appointed, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.,
By the whole Congregation it could not be, because their Acts were then no Laws: Therefore the maintenance of Pastors, before Emperours and Civill Soveraigns had made Laws to settle it, was nothing but Benevolence.,
Hitherto hath been shewn what the Pastors of the Church are; what are the points of their Commission (as that they were to Preach, to Teach, to Baptize, to be Presidents in their severall Congregations;) what is Ecclesiasticall Censure, viz.,
18.),
The Pastorall Authority Of Soveraigns Only Is De Jure Divino, That Of Other Pastors Is Jure Civili  If a man therefore should ask a Pastor, in the execution of his Office, as the chief Priests and Elders of the people (Mat.,
So also S. Paul, by the necessity of Preaching in divers and far distant places, Baptized few: Amongst all the Corinthians he Baptized only Crispus, Cajus, and Stephanus; (1 Cor.1.14,16.),
1.17.),
"to Lay his Hands on the head of the bullock;" and (ver.,
15.),
"to Lay his Hand on the head of the ramme.",
8.10.),
God commanded that "the Children of Israel should Put their Hands upon the Levites.",
24.14.),
God commanded that "all that heard him should Lay their Hands on his head, and that all the Congregation should stone him.",
And so much was this ceremony observed, that in blessing the whole Congregation at once, which cannot be done by Laying on of Hands, yet "Aaron (Levit.,
did lift up his Hand towards the people when he blessed them.",
whose daughter was sick, besought our Saviour (not to heal her, but) "to Lay his Hands upon her, that shee might bee healed.",
19.13.),
"they brought unto him little children, that hee should Put his Hands on them, and Pray.",
6.6.),
"The Apostles Prayed, and Laid their Hands" on the seven Deacons; which was done, not to give them the Holy Ghost, (for they were full of the Holy Ghost before thy were chosen, as appeareth immediately before, verse 3.),
8.17.)",
and laid their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.",
And not only an Apostle, but a Presbyter had this power: For S. Paul adviseth Timothy (1 Tim.,
"Lay Hands suddenly on no man;" that is, designe no man rashly to the Office of a Pastor.,
And in the Old Testament, though the Priest only had right to Consecrate, during the time that the Soveraignty was in the High Priest; yet it was not so when the Soveraignty was in the King: For we read (1 Kings 8.),
18.),
16.18, 19.),
"Thou art Peter, And upon this rock I will build my Church, &c. And I will give thee the keyes of Heaven; whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.",
3.2.),
preaching only this, "The Kingdome of God is at hand.",
4.17.),
10.7.),
16.13) not Peter onely, "Who men said he was;" and they answered, that "some said he was John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets:" Then (ver.,
15.),
he asked them all again, (not Peter onely) "Whom say yee that I am?",
But why then (will some object) doth our Saviour interpose these words, "Thou art Peter"?,
And for the following words, "I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven, &c." it is no more than what our Saviour gave also to all the rest of his Disciples (Matth.,
18.18.),
And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.",
And therefore Antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall marks; One, that he denyeth Jesus to be Christ; and another that he professeth himselfe to bee Christ.,
"Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; And this is the Spirit of Antichrist.",
"Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ;" and again, "If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ, there is Christ beleeve it not.",
And out of these two Marks, "to deny Jesus to be the Christ," and to "affirm himselfe to be the Christ," it followeth, that he must also be an "Adversary of the true Christ," which is another usuall signification of the word Antichrist.,
27.),
shall stand in the Holy place, and such tribulation as was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever shall be again, insomuch as if it were to last long, (ver.,
22.),
But that tribulation is not yet come; for it is to be followed immediately (ver.,
29.),
"Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired you that hee may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren.",
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rocke I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.",
"When the Spirit of truth is come, hee will lead you into all truth" where (saith he) by All Truth, is meant, at least, All Truth Necessary To Salvation.,
"The man that will doe presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest, (that standeth to Minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the Judge,) even that man shall die, and thou shalt put away the evill from Israel.",
"The man that will presume to disobey the Civill Soveraign for the time being, or any of his Officers in the execution of their places, that man shall die, &c." which is cleerly for the Civill Soveraignty, against the Universall power of the Pope.,
"Whatsoever yee shall bind, &c." and interpreteth it for such Binding as is attributed (Matth.,
23.4.),
to the Scribes and Pharisees, "They bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders;" by which is meant (he sayes) Making of Laws; and concludes thence, the Pope can make Laws.,
The words are, "As my Father sent me, so send I you.",
"It hath seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than these necessary things, that yee abstaine from meats offered to Idols, and from bloud, and from things strangled, and from fornication.",
But who is there, that reading this Text, can say, this stile of the Apostles may not as properly be used in giving Counsell, as in making Laws?,
25.),
But here, the Apostles aime onely at the benefit of the converted Gentiles, namely their Salvation; not at their own benefit; for having done their endeavour, they shall have their reward, whether they be obeyed, or not.,
"Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God;" which is meant, he saith not onely of Secular, but also of Ecclesiasticall Princes.,
For if the Apostle had meant, we should be subject both to our own Princes, and also to the Pope, he had taught us a doctrine, which Christ himself hath told us is impossible, namely, "to serve two Masters.",
"Shall I come unto you with a Rod, or in love, and the spirit of lenity?",
"A Bishop must be the husband but of one wife, vigilant, sober, &c." which he saith was a Law.,
And why are not also the Precepts of good Physitians, so many Laws?,
"Against an Elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three Witnesses," is a wise Precept, but not a Law.,
"He that heareth you, heareth mee; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.",
But who are those now that are sent by Christ, but such as are ordained Pastors by lawfull Authority?,
and who are lawfully ordained, that are not ordained by the Soveraign Pastor?,
and who is ordained by the Soveraign Pastor in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not ordained by the authority of the Soveraign thereof?,
"I commend you for keeping my Precepts as I delivered them to you.",
The Greek is, "I commend you for keeping those things I delivered to you, as I delivered them.",
1.),
"Not to beleeve every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, because many false Prophets are gone out into the world"?,
The Question Of Superiority Between The Pope And Other Bishops The last point hee would prove, is this, "That our Saviour Christ has committed Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction immediately to none but the Pope.",
But if a man may be said to have his Jurisdiction De Jure Divino, and yet not immediately; what lawfull Jurisdiction, though but Civill, is there in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not also De Jure Divino?,
and in another place, "My Kingdome is not of this world.",
His fift argument is this, "If Bishops have their Jurisdiction immediately from God, the Pope could not take it from them, for he can doe nothing contrary to Gods ordination;" And this consequence is good, and well proved.,
"But, (saith he) the Pope can do this, and has done it.",
deprived Abiathar the High Priest of his office, and placed Zadok (verse 35.),
The fourth is, "That the Pope has (in the Dominions of other Princes) the Supreme Temporall Power INDIRECTLY:" which is denyed; unlesse he mean by Indirectly, that he has gotten it by Indirect means; then is that also granted.,
"If a King at the Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeretiques, and being Excommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a year, his subjects are absolved of their Obedience.",
The first is this, "The Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall: Therefore he that hath the Supreme Power Spirituall, hath right to command Temporall Princes, and dispose of their Temporalls in order to the Spirituall.,
And the Argument stands thus, "The Civil Soveraign, is subject to the Spirituall; Therefore the Spirituall Prince may command Temporall Princes.",
And therefore are Subject to them.",
And thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first Argument, to deceive such men as distinguish not between the Subordination of Actions in the way to the End; and the Subjection of Persons one to another in the administration of the Means.,
The third Argument is this; "It is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate an Infidel, or Haereticall King, in case he endeavour to draw them to his Haeresie, or Infidelity.,
Therefore hath the Pope Right, to determine whether the Prince be to be deposed, or not deposed.",
Shall we say they did not onely obey, but also teach what they meant not, for want of strength?,
And whereas for the Temporall Power of the Pope, he alledgeth further, that St. Paul (1 Cor.,
6.),
This is true; for Christian Kings are no more but Christs Subjects: but they may, for all that, bee the Popes Fellowes; for they are Supreme Pastors of their own Subjects; and the Pope is no more but King, and Pastor, even in Rome it selfe.,
"Beware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves.",
The fact of Jehoiada, in Killing Athaliah (2 Kings 11.),
But if the command be such, as cannot be obeyed, without being damned to Eternall Death, then it were madnesse to obey it, and the Counsell of our Saviour takes place, (Mat.,
28.),
"Fear not those that kill the body, but cannot kill the soule.",
And To What Laws  But what Commandements are those that God hath given us?,
Are all those Laws which were given to the Jews by the hand of Moses, the Commandements of God?,
If they be not, what others are so, besides the Law of Nature?,
But because there be many false Prophets "gone out into the world," other men are to examine such Spirits (as St. John advised us, 1 Epistle, Chap.,
ver.1.),
"whether they be of God, or not.",
And therefore, seeing the Examination of Doctrines belongeth to the Supreme Pastor, the Person which all they that have no speciall revelation are to beleeve, is (in every Common-wealth) the Supreme Pastor, that is to say, the Civill Soveraigne.,
For how shall a man know the Infallibility of the Church, but by knowing first the Infallibility of the Scripture?,
Or how shall a man know his own Private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the Authority, and Arguments of his Teachers; or upon a Presumption of his own Gifts?,
It is the Doctrine of St. Paul concerning Christian Faith in generall, (Rom.,
10.17.),
14,15. of the same Chapter) "How shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?,
and how shall they Preach, except they be sent?",
But if Teaching be the cause of Faith, why doe not all beleeve?,
"These things are written, that you may know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.",
10.7. giveth he any Commission to them, other than this, "As ye go, Preach, saying, the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand;" that is, that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, the King which was to come.,
30.),
21.),
"Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall life; and they are they that testifie of mee.",

For when our Saviour (verse 26.),
had said to Martha, "Beleevest thou this?",
she answereth (verse 27.),
"Yea Lord, I beleeve that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world;" Therefore this Article alone is faith sufficient to life eternall; and more than sufficient is not Necessary.,
"These things are written that yee might beleeve, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that beleeving yee might have life through his name.",
"Every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.",
"whosoever beleeveth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.",
"Who is hee that overcommeth the world, but he that beleeveth that Jesus is the Son of God?",
"See (saith the Eunuch) here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?,
And hee answered and said, I beleeve that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.",
"Though we, or an Angell from Heaven preach any other Gospell unto you, than that wee have preached unto you, let him bee accursed.",
Hereby yee shall know the Spirit of God; every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.",
11, 12, &c.) "Other Foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus is the Christ.,
If any mans work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward: If any mans work shall bee burnt, he shall suffer losse; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.",
The day of Judgment, is the day of the Restauration of the Kingdome of God; and at that day it is, that St. Peter tells us (2 Pet.,
3. v.7, 10, 12.),
For who is there that does not see, that they who beleeve Jesus to be the Son of the God of Israel, and that the Israelites had for God the Omnipotent Creator of all things, doe therein also beleeve, that God is the Omnipotent Creator of all things?,
Or how can a man beleeve, that Jesus is the King that shall reign eternally, unlesse hee beleeve him also risen again from the dead?,
In summe, he that holdeth this Foundation, Jesus Is The Christ, holdeth Expressely all that hee seeth rightly deduced from it, and Implicitely all that is consequent thereunto, though he have not skill enough to discern the consequence.,
The men to whom St. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, next after the Ascension of our Saviour, asked him, and the rest of the Apostles, saying, (Act.,
"Men and Brethren what shall we doe?",
to whom St. Peter answered (in the next verse) "Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.",
"What shall I doe to inherit eternall life?",
1.17.),
"The Just shall live by Faith;" not every one, but the Just; therefore Faith and Justice (that is, the Will To Be Just, or Repentance) are all that is Necessary to life eternall.,
What Each Of Them Contributes Thereunto  Seeing then it is Necessary that Faith, and Obedience (implyed in the word Repentance) do both concurre to our Salvation; the question by which of the two we are Justified, is impertinently disputed.,
Neverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make manifest in what manner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it is said, that we are to be Justified by the one, and by the other.,
And in this sense onely it is, that a man is called Just, or Unjust; and that his Justice Justifies him, that is, gives him the title, in Gods acceptation, of Just; and renders him capable of Living By His Faith, which before he was not.,
And in case a Subject be forbidden by the Civill Soveraign to professe some of those his opinions, upon what grounds can he disobey?,
Christian Kings may erre in deducing a Consequence, but who shall Judge?,
Shall a private man Judge, when the question is of his own obedience?,
or shall any man Judg but he that is appointed thereto by the Church, that is, by the Civill Soveraign that representeth it?,
or if the Pope, or an Apostle Judge, may he not erre in deducing of a consequence?,
OF SPIRITUALL DARKNESSE FROM MISINTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE     The Kingdome Of Darknesse What  Besides these Soveraign Powers, Divine, and Humane, of which I have hitherto discoursed, there is mention in Scripture of another Power, namely, (Eph.,
), that of "the Rulers of the Darknesse of this world," (Mat.,
), "the Principality of Beelzebub over Daemons," that is to say, over Phantasmes that appear in the Air: For which cause Satan is also called (Eph.,
2.),
"the Prince of the Power of the Air;" and (because he ruleth in the darknesse of this world) (Joh.,
11.),
Whence comes it, that in Christendome there has been, almost from the time of the Apostles, such justling of one another out of their places, both by forraign, and Civill war?,
And so we come to erre, by "giving heed to seducing Spirits," and the Daemonology of such "as speak lies in Hypocrisie," (or as it is in the Originall, 1 Tim.,
"That if a King at the Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeresies, and being excommunicate for the same, doe not give satisfaction within a year, his Subjects are absolved of the bond of their obedience.",
But when by such words, the nature of qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be changed, it is not Consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of God, or a vaine and impious Conjuration.,
For hee never said, that of what Bread soever, any Priest whatsoever, should say, "This is my Body," or, "This is Christs Body," the same should presently be transubstantiated.,
"That all the Power of the Enemy, all the Host of the Devill, all Assaults and Phantasmes of Satan, may be driven away by this Creature of Oyle.",
And for the Infant that is to be Baptized, he is subject to many Charms; First, at the Church dore the Priest blows thrice in the Childs face, and sayes, "Goe out of him unclean Spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost the Comforter.",
"Eate not the Bloud, for the Bloud is the Soule;" that is "the Life.",
But that the Souls of the Faithfull, are not of their own Nature, but by Gods speciall Grace, to remaine in their bodies, from the Resurrection to all Eternity, I have already I think sufficiently proved out of the Scriptures, in the 38.,
Answer To The Text On Which Beza Infereth  That The Kingdome Of Christ Began At The Resurrection The words are (Marke 9.1.),
"Verily, I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not tast of death, till they have seene the Kingdome of God come with power.",
And then there is another place more difficult: For when the Apostles after our Saviours Resurrection, and immediately before his Ascension, asked our Saviour, saying, (Acts.1.6.),
1.9, 10.),
Againe, if the Kingdome of God began (as Beza on that place (Mark 9.1.),
would have it) at the Resurrection; what reason is there for Christians ever since the Resurrection to say in their prayers, "Let thy Kingdome Come"?,
If then this Kingdome were to come at the Resurrection of Christ, why is it said, "some of them" rather than all?,
"If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?",
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus, &c." So that they saw Christ in Glory and Majestie, as he is to come; insomuch as "They were sore afraid.",
And thus the promise of our Saviour was accomplished by way of Vision: For it was a Vision, as may probably bee inferred out of St. Luke, that reciteth the same story (ch.,
28.),
(where the same is again related;) for our Saviour charged them, saying, "Tell no man the Vision untill the Son of man be Risen from the dead.",
Psalm, "Thou shalt Tread upon the Lion and the Adder, the young Lion and the Dragon thou shalt Trample under thy feet.",
40.),
When King Solomon, (the civill Soveraigne of Israel) consecrated the Temple hee had built, (2 Kings 8.),
And first there are the words of Solomon (Ecclesiastes 12.7.),
"Then shall the Dust return to Dust, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God that gave it.",
Which may bear well enough (if there be no other text directly against it) this interpretation, that God onely knows, (but Man not,) what becomes of a mans spirit, when he expireth; and the same Solomon, in the same Book, (Chap.,
That is, none knows but God; Nor is it an unusuall phrase to say of things we understand not, "God knows what," and "God knows where.",
3.19.),
"That which befalleth the Sons of Men, befalleth Beasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dyeth, so doth the other; yea, they have all one breath (one spirit;) so that a Man hath no praeeminence above a Beast, for all is vanity.",
ver.3.),
15.),
The Elect are the onely children of the Resurrection; that is to say the sole heirs of Eternall Life: they only can die no more; it is they that are equall to the Angels, and that are the children of God; and not the Reprobate.,
35.),
"O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure:" What were this to Purgatory, if Augustine had not applied the Wrath to the fire of Hell, and the Displeasure, to that of Purgatory?,
"Wee went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us to a moist place;" and other the like texts, (with which the Doctors of those times entended to adorne, or extend their Sermons, or Commentaries) haled to their purposes by force of wit?,
But what then can bee the meaning of those our Saviours words?,
29.),
"What shall they doe which are Baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?,
why also are they Baptized for the dead?",
3. where it is said that they which built Stubble, Hay, &c. on the true Foundation, their work shall perish; but "they themselves shall be saved; but as through Fire:" This Fire, he will have to be the Fire of Purgatory.,
59.),
But it is evident the Fire and Purging here mentioned, is the same whereof the Prophet Zachary speaketh (chap.,
9.),
"I will bring the third part through the Fire, and will Refine them, &c." And St. Peter after him (1 Epist.,
7.),
"That the triall of your Faith, which is much more precious than of Gold that perisheth, though it be tryed with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and glory at the Appearing of Jesus Christ;" And St. Paul (1 Cor.,
13.),
The Fire shall trie every mans work of what sort it is.",
But St. Peter, and St. Paul speak of the Fire that shall be at the Second Appearing of Christ; and the Prophet Zachary of the Day of Judgment: And therefore this place of S. Mat.,
"Agree with thine Adversary quickly, whilest thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the Adversary deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into prison.,
Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou has paid the uttermost farthing.",
"Whosoever is angry with his Brother without a cause, shall be guilty in Judgment.,
But whosoever shall say, Thou Foole, shall be guilty to hell fire.",
Shall not all Judicature appertain to Christ, and his Apostles?,
"Make yee friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when yee faile, they may receive you into Everlasting Tabernacles.",
"Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome:" Therefore, saith hee, there is Remission of sins after this life.,
But if that which Beza sayes in his notes on this place be well observed, there is none that will not see, that in stead of Paynes, it should be Bands; and then there is no further cause to seek for Purgatory in this Text.,
18.),
for the singularity of his fasting, that he had a Devill; and of our Saviour, because he said, hee that keepeth his sayings should not see Death In Aeternum, (John 8.,
"Now we know thou hast a Devill; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead:" And again, because he said (John 7.,
20.),
"They went about to kill him," the people answered, "Thou hast a Devill, who goeth about to kill thee?",
Why Our Saviour Controlled It Not  Which doctrine if it be not true, why (may some say) did not our Saviour contradict it, and teach the Contrary?,
nay why does he use on diverse occasions, such forms of speech as seem to confirm it?,
But when our Saviour speaketh to the Devill, and commandeth him to go out of a man, if by the Devill, be meant a Disease, as Phrenesy, or Lunacy, or a corporeal Spirit, is not the speech improper?,
or can there be a corporeall Spirit in a Body of Flesh and Bone, full already of vitall and animall Spirits?,
Are there not therefore Spirits, that neither have Bodies, nor are meer Imaginations?,
The Scriptures Doe Not Teach That Spirits Are Incorporeall  Our Saviour, immediately after the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a Dove, is said by St. Matthew (Chapt.,
1.),
1.),
And whereas in the verses following, he is said "to have been taken up by the Devill into the Holy City, and set upon a pinnacle of the Temple," shall we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the Devill, or carryed thither by violence?,
What then can be the meaning of this place, other than that he went of himself into the Wildernesse; and that this carrying of him up and down, from the Wildernesse to the City, and from thence into a Mountain, was a Vision?,
Conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of St. Luke, that hee was led into the Wildernesse, not By, but In the Spirit: whereas concerning His being Taken up into the Mountaine, and unto the Pinnacle of the Temple, hee speaketh as St. Matthew doth.,
But if there be no Immateriall Spirit, nor any Possession of mens bodies by any Spirit Corporeall, it may again be asked, why our Saviour and his Apostles did not teach the People so; and in such cleer words, as they might no more doubt thereof.,
And I find that there are Spirits Corporeal, (though subtile and Invisible;) but not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them; And that the Bodies of the Saints shall be such, namely, Spirituall Bodies, as St. Paul calls them.,
17.),
And the second was, that "they should not make to themselves any Image to Worship, of their own Invention.",
But the inward thoughts of men, which appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes of our Honoring, and these goe by the name of WORSHIP, in Latine, CULTUS.,
For the Commandement is, "Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven image.",
For we read not, that the Priest, or any other did worship the Cherubins; but contrarily wee read (2 Kings 18.4.),
And therefore from the Cherubins, or Brazen Serpent, to the Images of mans devising; and from the Worship commanded by God, to the Will-Worship of men, the argument is not good.,

But to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the doctrine of Government and Obedience?,
Or who will not obey a Priest, that can make God, rather than his Soveraign; nay than God himselfe?,
Powring In Of Soules  For the cause of the Soule of Man, they say, Creatur Infundendo, and Creando Infunditur: that is, "It is Created by Powring it in," and "Powred in by Creation.",
What man, that has his naturall Senses, though he can neither write nor read, does not find himself governed by them he fears, and beleeves can kill or hurt him when he obeyeth not?,

4. verse 1.),
But what reason is there for it?,
Is it because such opinions are contrary to true Religion?,
Is it because they be contrary to the Religion established?,
Is it because they tend to disorder in Government, as countenancing Rebellion, or Sedition?,
For what is it for men to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places of Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom?,
Or what is it, without Authority from the Civill Soveraign, to excommunicate any person, but to take from him his Lawfull Liberty, that is, to usurpe an unlawfull Power over their Brethren?,
For who is there, that beleeving this to be true, will not readily obey him in whatsoever he commands?,
And the number of Presbyters encreasing, the Presbyters of the chief City or Province, got themselves an authority over the parochiall Presbyters, and appropriated to themselves the names of Bishops: And this was a second knot on Christian Liberty.,
But these are contrary Faculties; the former being grounded upon principles of Truth; the other upon Opinions already received, true, or false; and upon the Passions and Interests of men, which are different, and mutable.,

Seeing therefore such contribution is every where, as a thing inevitable, (notwithstanding it be an assistance to the Enemy,) esteemed lawfull; as totall Submission, which is but an assistance to the Enemy, cannot be esteemed unlawfull.,
