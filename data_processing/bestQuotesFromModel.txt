'Aristole.txt' by Aristole

"Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.'"
'It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.' 
"Such an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'"
"Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must be simple, or complex, or 'ethical,' or 'pathetic.'"
"Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'--while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound of flutes and pipes.'" 
'Critics jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy.' 
"The impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality."
"In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.'"

'ScarletLetter.txt' by Nathaniel Hawthorne

'No aim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful.'
'If thou feelest it to be for thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer!' 
'“Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder child!'
'I,—a man of thought,—the bookworm of great libraries,—a man already in decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledge,—what had I to do with youth and beauty like thine own!'
'Were it not, thinkest thou, for thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth?'
'Without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny!'
'If they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement!' 
'Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can be better—can be more for God’s glory, or man’s welfare—than God’s own truth?'
'He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!', 'But see, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself!'
'But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record!'
'I pity thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”  “And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend!' 
'If not for his sake, then doubly for thine own!', 'Forgive, and leave his further retribution to the Power that claims it!'
'Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?'
'Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question!'
'“Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us?'
'So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy!'
'Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits!'
'Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together?'
'After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike.'
'Among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister’s miserable experience, we put only this into a sentence:—“Be true!', 'Be true!', 'Be true!'

'Apology.txt' by Plato 

What could be the meaning of this—that he who knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing, should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men?
The question may be asked, Why will he persist in following a profession which leads him to death?
For he will certainly obey God rather than man; and will continue to preach to all men of all ages the necessity of virtue and improvement; and if they refuse to listen to him he will still persevere and reprove them.
Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.
May I succeed, if to succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause!
I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really wiser and better.
But now please to answer the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?
“Let me die forthwith and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the earth.”
For the fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the unknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.
When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil?
For I am quite sure that wherever I go, there, as here, the young men will flock to me; and if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request; and if I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes.
But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?
Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not.

'ThePrince.txt' by Nicolo Machiavelli

Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.  
The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.

'TheRepublic.txt' by Plato

But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make men more evil?
Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold?
'If because I do evil, Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?'
The language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like--all which tends to show that justice is the interest of the stronger; and that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.'
Is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice? Is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also?
And is not the end of the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained?
'Justice is like the arts in having no external interest, and in not aiming at excess, and justice is to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.'
'virtue is concerned with action, art with production'
Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in the words 'men who are injured are made more unjust.'
'When workmen strive to do better than well, They do confound their skill in covetousness.'
How different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality!
His high character makes him a ruler; he can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.'
"Virtue", as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable."
I hear some one saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which I reply that "nothing great is easy."
Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there are gods?
let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice
that power is the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are public benefits.
What the poets and story-tellers say--that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another's gain?
Has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once?
But what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home?
'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.'
For he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to others.
Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another?
If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as a whole.'
Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,' 'harmony;' but while the idea of good embraces 'all time and all existence,' the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.
Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;' the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.'
Admitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another?
Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself?
At the same time, if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself, he must be reminded that 'half is better than the whole.'
'Socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.'
Are the lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?'
Suppose we say that, if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only.
Now I would ask my good friend, who denies abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view different--the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust?
And he who grovels in the world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is not a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...
Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty, truth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask whether they or the many shall be rulers in our State.
If at this instant a friend whispers to him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be educated--do you think that he will listen?
When mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it?
Ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything?
And will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science?
For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man.
But if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction?
And suppose further, that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of light?
And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world?
Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way is there from darkness to light?
No one can fail to see that the contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.'
And so we get four names--two for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion-- being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding: perception of shadows.
Nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus, 'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.'
Thus liberty, when out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of servitude
If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of themselves?
'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.'
We must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy, and that 'which is the most holy will be the most useful.'
The question is asked, 'Whether the state of innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own which possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is the preferable condition of man.'
To injure a friend or anyone else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust
The just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike
Injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship
And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death?
Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him? And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?
Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly
And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies
And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well
Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same
Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same
There is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow
Where there is no common but only private feeling a State is disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens
When any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him
This unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain
And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?
And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to man
Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?
Injustice is a gain to the perfectly unjust who are reputed to be just
Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?'
The imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is easily imitated
'Even for the last comer, if he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence.

'Leviathan.txt' by Thomas Hobbes

For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principal part within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificial life?
In sum, in what matter soever there is place for Addition and Substraction, there also is place for Reason; and where these have no place, there Reason has nothing at all to do.
The secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane, clean, obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verbal discourse cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the Time, Place, and Persons.
Justice is the constant will of giving to every man his own.

'BeyondGoodAndEvil1.txt' by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche'

"Philosophy itself is criticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!"
Well-being, as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible--and makes his destruction DESIRABLE!,
And that YOUR sympathy for the "creature in man" applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refined--to that which must necessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer?,
It is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting!,

Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away?,
WHAT really is this "Will to Truth" in us?,
Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth?,
The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem?,
And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it?,
"HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite?,
But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!",
It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, "DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.",
But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous "Perhapses"!,
Supposing, in effect, that man is not just the "measure of things.",
Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: "What morality do they (or does he) aim at?",
Accordingly, I do not believe that an "impulse to knowledge" is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!),
How malicious philosophers can be!,
And the latter is really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of which Epicurus was not a master!,
You desire to LIVE "according to Nature"?,
Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words!,
To live--is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature?,
Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?,
And granted that your imperative, "living according to Nature," means actually the same as "living according to life"--how could you do DIFFERENTLY?,
Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be?,
In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders!,
Therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us!,
Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he said: "This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.",
Let us only understand this "could be"!,
"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?",
Kant asks himself--and what is really his answer?,
People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the "Politics of hard fact.",
All the young theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for "faculties.",
And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between "finding" and "inventing"!,
"By means of a means (faculty)," namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,      Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,     Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.,
But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, "How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible?",
by another question, "Why is belief in such judgments necessary?",
--in effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments!,
Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science!,
In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's inconsistency).,
It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!),
To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!,
But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs!,
But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs!,
Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs--?,
I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that "immediate certainty," as well as "absolute knowledge" and the "thing in itself," involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!,
For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'?,
What gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought?",
"Sir," the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, "it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?",
ONE thinks; but that this "one" is precisely the famous old "ego," is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an "immediate certainty.",
One infers here according to the usual grammatical formula--"To think is an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently"...,
The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly.,
And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as "la religion de la souffrance humaine"; that is ITS "good taste.",
It is no matter of fact, no "text," but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul!,
"Ni dieu, ni maitre"--that, also, is what you want; and therefore "Cheers for natural law!",
Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.,
And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so!,
let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!,
O sancta simplicitas!,
And only on this solidified, granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue!,
Not as its opposite, but--as its refinement!,
Take care, ye philosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom!,
Of suffering "for the truth's sake"!,
And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared!,
Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever!,
For as such, he would one day have to say to himself: "The devil take my good taste!,
but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception--than myself, the exception!",
And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go "inside.",
It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.],
], or at best "froglike," mandeikagati [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.],
(I do everything to be "difficultly understood" myself!),
What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the "ancient world," when like him, one has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN!,
--A decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also still--youth!,
Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, "Know thyself!",
Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion of perspective!,
There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments "for others" and "NOT for myself," for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: "Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?",
Let us therefore be cautious!,
and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing?,
The belief in "immediate certainties" is a MORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being "MERELY moral" men!,
Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which does little honour to us!,
Indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of "true" and "false"?,
And to any one who suggested: "But to a fiction belongs an originator?",
--might it not be bluntly replied: WHY?,
Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as towards the predicate and object?,
All respect to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess-faith?,
O humanity!,
O idiocy!,
There is something ticklish in "the truth," and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it too humanely--"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien"--I wager he finds nothing!,
"What?,
Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but not the devil?",
--On the contrary!,
And who the devil also compels you to speak popularly!,
Have not we ourselves been--that "noble posterity"?,
And, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it not--thereby already past?,
Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est.",
Should not the CONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in?,
Will they be new friends of "truth," these coming philosophers?,
And how could there be a "common good"!,
What wonder that we "free spirits" are not exactly the most communicative spirits?,
that we do not wish to betray in every respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will then be driven?,
But how often must he say despairingly to himself: "A single individual!,
and this great forest, this virgin forest!",
And who would have time to wait for such servants!--they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at all times!,
Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know something; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me!,
How strangely pious for our taste are still these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their origin!,
And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance!,
COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C'EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?"...,
These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage on finding them, I wrote on the margin, "LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR EXCELLENCE!",
--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted!,
The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary privation--why did they thus bow?,
There is perhaps a reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors?,
"The father" in God is thoroughly refuted; equally so "the judge," "the rewarder.",
What does all modern philosophy mainly do?,
Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice?,
Was it not necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness?,
And this would not be--circulus vitiosus deus?,

The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile "reformed.",
"I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can no longer believe in you.",
How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it!,
In every "Science of Morals" hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there!,
A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?,
Apart from the value of such assertions as "there is a categorical imperative in us," one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it?,
