"Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.'"
'It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.' 
"Such an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'"
"Epic poetry must have as many kinds as Tragedy: it must be simple, or complex, or 'ethical,' or 'pathetic.'"
"Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'--while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound of flutes and pipes.'" 
'Critics jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy.' 
"The impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality."
"In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.'"

'ScarletLetter.txt' by Nathaniel Hawthorne

'No aim, that I have ever cherished, would they recognize as laudable; no success of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful.'
'If thou feelest it to be for thy soul’s peace, and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation, I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner and fellow-sufferer!' 
'“Live, therefore, and bear about thy doom with thee, in the eyes of men and women,—in the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husband,—in the eyes of yonder child!'
'I,—a man of thought,—the bookworm of great libraries,—a man already in decay, having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledge,—what had I to do with youth and beauty like thine own!'
'Were it not, thinkest thou, for thy little one’s temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge, and clad soberly, and disciplined strictly, and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth?'
'Without question, she is equally in the dark as to her soul, its present depravity, and future destiny!'
'If they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement!' 
'Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can be better—can be more for God’s glory, or man’s welfare—than God’s own truth?'
'He, if it stand with his good pleasure, can cure; or he can kill!', 'But see, now, how passion takes hold upon this man, and hurrieth him out of himself!'
'But what shall we say, when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone, on the same vast sheet of record!'
'I pity thee, for the good that has been wasted in thy nature!”  “And I thee,” answered Hester Prynne, “for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend!' 
'If not for his sake, then doubly for thine own!', 'Forgive, and leave his further retribution to the Power that claims it!'
'Is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works?'
'Truth was the one virtue which I might have held fast, and did hold fast, through all extremity; save when thy good,—thy life,—thy fame,—were put in question!'
'“Doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town, which only a little time ago was but a leaf-strewn desert, as lonely as this around us?'
'So brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched, to one where thou mayest still be happy!'
'Such was the sympathy of Nature—that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth—with the bliss of these two spirits!'
'Be the foregone evil what it might, how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined, when they beheld at once the material union, and the spiritual idea, in whom they met, and were to dwell immortally together?'
'After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind’s spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike.'
'Among many morals which press upon us from the poor minister’s miserable experience, we put only this into a sentence:—“Be true!', 'Be true!', 'Be true!'

'Apology.txt' by Plato 

What could be the meaning of this—that he who knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing, should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men?
The question may be asked, Why will he persist in following a profession which leads him to death?
For he will certainly obey God rather than man; and will continue to preach to all men of all ages the necessity of virtue and improvement; and if they refuse to listen to him he will still persevere and reprove them.
Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words, and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.
May I succeed, if to succeed be for my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause!
I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really wiser and better.
But now please to answer the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?
“Let me die forthwith and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the earth.”
For the fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the unknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.
When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil?
For I am quite sure that wherever I go, there, as here, the young men will flock to me; and if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request; and if I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes.
But if death is the journey to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than this?
Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not.

'ThePrince.txt' by Nicolo Machiavelli

Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.  
The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.

'TheRepublic.txt' by Plato

But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make men more evil?
Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold?
'If because I do evil, Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?'
The language of men proves this--our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like--all which tends to show that justice is the interest of the stronger; and that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.'
Is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice? Is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also?
And is not the end of the soul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained?
'Justice is like the arts in having no external interest, and in not aiming at excess, and justice is to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.'
'virtue is concerned with action, art with production'
Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in the words 'men who are injured are made more unjust.'
'When workmen strive to do better than well, They do confound their skill in covetousness.'
How different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality!
His high character makes him a ruler; he can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better, and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.'
"Virtue", as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable."
I hear some one saying that "wickedness is not easily concealed," to which I reply that "nothing great is easy."
Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there are gods?
let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice
that power is the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are public benefits.
What the poets and story-tellers say--that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another's gain?
Has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once?
But what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home?
'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.'
For he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to others.
Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another?
If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as a whole.'
Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,' 'harmony;' but while the idea of good embraces 'all time and all existence,' the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.
Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;' the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.'
Admitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally differ from one another?
Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself?
At the same time, if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself, he must be reminded that 'half is better than the whole.'
'Socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.'
Are the lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?'
Suppose we say that, if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only.
Now I would ask my good friend, who denies abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view different--the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust?
And he who grovels in the world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is not a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...
Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty, truth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask whether they or the many shall be rulers in our State.
If at this instant a friend whispers to him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be educated--do you think that he will listen?
When mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it?
Ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything?
And will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science?
For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man.
But if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction?
And suppose further, that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of light?
And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world?
Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way is there from darkness to light?
No one can fail to see that the contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.'
And so we get four names--two for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion-- being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding: perception of shadows.
Nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus, 'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.'
Thus liberty, when out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of servitude
If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of themselves?
'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.'
We must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy, and that 'which is the most holy will be the most useful.'
The question is asked, 'Whether the state of innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own which possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is the preferable condition of man.'
To injure a friend or anyone else is not the act of a just man, but of the opposite, who is the unjust
The just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike
Injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship
And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death?
Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him? And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?
Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly
And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies
And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but by knowledge, do men counsel well
Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same
Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the same nurture and education
You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the same
There is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow
Where there is no common but only private feeling a State is disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens
When any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with him
This unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain
And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?
And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to man
Is any better than experience and wisdom and reason?
Injustice is a gain to the perfectly unjust who are reputed to be just
Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?'
The imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is easily imitated
'Even for the last comer, if he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence.

'Leviathan1.txt' by 'Thomas Hobbes'

For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the begining whereof is in some principal part within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificial life?
In sum, in what matter soever there is place for Addition and Substraction, there also is place for Reason; and where these have no place, there Reason has nothing at all to do.
The secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane, clean, obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verbal discourse cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the Time, Place, and Persons.
Justice is the constant will of giving to every man his own.

"Brethren looke you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and of Wisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse.",
"Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part amongst them, I am thy part, and thine inheritance amongst the Children of Israel.",
By which it is probable, their ordinary maintenance was not unsuitable to their employment; for their employment was (ver.,
upon the mony which was made of the sale of their lands and possessions, and laid down at the feet of the Apostles, of good will, not of duty; for "whilest the Land remained (saith S. Peter to Ananias Acts 5.4.),
and after it was sold, was it not in thy power?",
The Ministers Of The Gospel Lived On The Benevolence Of Their Flocks But here may some ask, whether the Pastor were then bound to live upon voluntary contribution, as upon almes, "For who (saith S. Paul 1 Cor.,
or who feedeth a flock, and eatheth not of the milke of the flock?",
"Doe ye not know that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at the Altar, partake with the Altar;" that is to say, have part of that which is offered at the Altar for their maintenance?,
And then he concludeth, "Even so hath the Lord appointed, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.,
By the whole Congregation it could not be, because their Acts were then no Laws: Therefore the maintenance of Pastors, before Emperours and Civill Soveraigns had made Laws to settle it, was nothing but Benevolence.,
Hitherto hath been shewn what the Pastors of the Church are; what are the points of their Commission (as that they were to Preach, to Teach, to Baptize, to be Presidents in their severall Congregations;) what is Ecclesiasticall Censure, viz.,
The Pastorall Authority Of Soveraigns Only Is De Jure Divino, That Of Other Pastors Is Jure Civili  If a man therefore should ask a Pastor, in the execution of his Office, as the chief Priests and Elders of the people (Mat.,
So also S. Paul, by the necessity of Preaching in divers and far distant places, Baptized few: Amongst all the Corinthians he Baptized only Crispus, Cajus, and Stephanus; (1 Cor.1.14,16.),
"to Lay his Hands on the head of the bullock;" and (ver.,
"to Lay his Hand on the head of the ramme.",
God commanded that "the Children of Israel should Put their Hands upon the Levites.",
God commanded that "all that heard him should Lay their Hands on his head, and that all the Congregation should stone him.",
And so much was this ceremony observed, that in blessing the whole Congregation at once, which cannot be done by Laying on of Hands, yet "Aaron (Levit.,
did lift up his Hand towards the people when he blessed them.",
whose daughter was sick, besought our Saviour (not to heal her, but) "to Lay his Hands upon her, that shee might bee healed.",
"they brought unto him little children, that hee should Put his Hands on them, and Pray.",
"The Apostles Prayed, and Laid their Hands" on the seven Deacons; which was done, not to give them the Holy Ghost, (for they were full of the Holy Ghost before thy were chosen, as appeareth immediately before, verse 3.),
and laid their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.",
And not only an Apostle, but a Presbyter had this power: For S. Paul adviseth Timothy (1 Tim.,
"Lay Hands suddenly on no man;" that is, designe no man rashly to the Office of a Pastor.,
And in the Old Testament, though the Priest only had right to Consecrate, during the time that the Soveraignty was in the High Priest; yet it was not so when the Soveraignty was in the King: For we read (1 Kings 8.),
"Thou art Peter, And upon this rock I will build my Church, &c. And I will give thee the keyes of Heaven; whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.",
preaching only this, "The Kingdome of God is at hand.",
16.13) not Peter onely, "Who men said he was;" and they answered, that "some said he was John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the Prophets:" Then (ver.,
he asked them all again, (not Peter onely) "Whom say yee that I am?",
But why then (will some object) doth our Saviour interpose these words, "Thou art Peter"?,
And for the following words, "I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven, &c." it is no more than what our Saviour gave also to all the rest of his Disciples (Matth.,
And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.",
And therefore Antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall marks; One, that he denyeth Jesus to be Christ; and another that he professeth himselfe to bee Christ.,
"Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; And this is the Spirit of Antichrist.",
"Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ;" and again, "If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ, there is Christ beleeve it not.",
And out of these two Marks, "to deny Jesus to be the Christ," and to "affirm himselfe to be the Christ," it followeth, that he must also be an "Adversary of the true Christ," which is another usuall signification of the word Antichrist.,
27.),
shall stand in the Holy place, and such tribulation as was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever shall be again, insomuch as if it were to last long, (ver.,
22.),
But that tribulation is not yet come; for it is to be followed immediately (ver.,
29.),
"Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired you that hee may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren.",
"Thou art Peter, and upon this rocke I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.",
"When the Spirit of truth is come, hee will lead you into all truth" where (saith he) by All Truth, is meant, at least, All Truth Necessary To Salvation.,
"The man that will doe presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest, (that standeth to Minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the Judge,) even that man shall die, and thou shalt put away the evill from Israel.",
"The man that will presume to disobey the Civill Soveraign for the time being, or any of his Officers in the execution of their places, that man shall die, &c." which is cleerly for the Civill Soveraignty, against the Universall power of the Pope.,
"Whatsoever yee shall bind, &c." and interpreteth it for such Binding as is attributed (Matth.,
23.4.),
to the Scribes and Pharisees, "They bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders;" by which is meant (he sayes) Making of Laws; and concludes thence, the Pope can make Laws.,
The words are, "As my Father sent me, so send I you.",
"It hath seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than these necessary things, that yee abstaine from meats offered to Idols, and from bloud, and from things strangled, and from fornication.",
But who is there, that reading this Text, can say, this stile of the Apostles may not as properly be used in giving Counsell, as in making Laws?,
25.),
But here, the Apostles aime onely at the benefit of the converted Gentiles, namely their Salvation; not at their own benefit; for having done their endeavour, they shall have their reward, whether they be obeyed, or not.,
"Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God;" which is meant, he saith not onely of Secular, but also of Ecclesiasticall Princes.,
For if the Apostle had meant, we should be subject both to our own Princes, and also to the Pope, he had taught us a doctrine, which Christ himself hath told us is impossible, namely, "to serve two Masters.",
"Shall I come unto you with a Rod, or in love, and the spirit of lenity?",
"A Bishop must be the husband but of one wife, vigilant, sober, &c." which he saith was a Law.,
And why are not also the Precepts of good Physitians, so many Laws?,
"Against an Elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three Witnesses," is a wise Precept, but not a Law.,
"He that heareth you, heareth mee; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.",
But who are those now that are sent by Christ, but such as are ordained Pastors by lawfull Authority?,
and who are lawfully ordained, that are not ordained by the Soveraign Pastor?,
and who is ordained by the Soveraign Pastor in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not ordained by the authority of the Soveraign thereof?,
"I commend you for keeping my Precepts as I delivered them to you.",
The Greek is, "I commend you for keeping those things I delivered to you, as I delivered them.",
1.),
"Not to beleeve every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, because many false Prophets are gone out into the world"?,
The Question Of Superiority Between The Pope And Other Bishops The last point hee would prove, is this, "That our Saviour Christ has committed Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction immediately to none but the Pope.",
But if a man may be said to have his Jurisdiction De Jure Divino, and yet not immediately; what lawfull Jurisdiction, though but Civill, is there in a Christian Common-wealth, that is not also De Jure Divino?,
and in another place, "My Kingdome is not of this world.",
His fift argument is this, "If Bishops have their Jurisdiction immediately from God, the Pope could not take it from them, for he can doe nothing contrary to Gods ordination;" And this consequence is good, and well proved.,
"But, (saith he) the Pope can do this, and has done it.",
deprived Abiathar the High Priest of his office, and placed Zadok (verse 35.),
The fourth is, "That the Pope has (in the Dominions of other Princes) the Supreme Temporall Power INDIRECTLY:" which is denyed; unlesse he mean by Indirectly, that he has gotten it by Indirect means; then is that also granted.,
"If a King at the Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeretiques, and being Excommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a year, his subjects are absolved of their Obedience.",
The first is this, "The Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall: Therefore he that hath the Supreme Power Spirituall, hath right to command Temporall Princes, and dispose of their Temporalls in order to the Spirituall.,
And the Argument stands thus, "The Civil Soveraign, is subject to the Spirituall; Therefore the Spirituall Prince may command Temporall Princes.",
And therefore are Subject to them.",
And thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first Argument, to deceive such men as distinguish not between the Subordination of Actions in the way to the End; and the Subjection of Persons one to another in the administration of the Means.,
The third Argument is this; "It is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate an Infidel, or Haereticall King, in case he endeavour to draw them to his Haeresie, or Infidelity.,
Therefore hath the Pope Right, to determine whether the Prince be to be deposed, or not deposed.",
Shall we say they did not onely obey, but also teach what they meant not, for want of strength?,
And whereas for the Temporall Power of the Pope, he alledgeth further, that St. Paul (1 Cor.,
6.),
This is true; for Christian Kings are no more but Christs Subjects: but they may, for all that, bee the Popes Fellowes; for they are Supreme Pastors of their own Subjects; and the Pope is no more but King, and Pastor, even in Rome it selfe.,
"Beware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves.",
The fact of Jehoiada, in Killing Athaliah (2 Kings 11.),
But if the command be such, as cannot be obeyed, without being damned to Eternall Death, then it were madnesse to obey it, and the Counsell of our Saviour takes place, (Mat.,
28.),
"Fear not those that kill the body, but cannot kill the soule.",
And To What Laws  But what Commandements are those that God hath given us?,
Are all those Laws which were given to the Jews by the hand of Moses, the Commandements of God?,
If they be not, what others are so, besides the Law of Nature?,
But because there be many false Prophets "gone out into the world," other men are to examine such Spirits (as St. John advised us, 1 Epistle, Chap.,
ver.1.),
"whether they be of God, or not.",
And therefore, seeing the Examination of Doctrines belongeth to the Supreme Pastor, the Person which all they that have no speciall revelation are to beleeve, is (in every Common-wealth) the Supreme Pastor, that is to say, the Civill Soveraigne.,
For how shall a man know the Infallibility of the Church, but by knowing first the Infallibility of the Scripture?,
Or how shall a man know his own Private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the Authority, and Arguments of his Teachers; or upon a Presumption of his own Gifts?,
It is the Doctrine of St. Paul concerning Christian Faith in generall, (Rom.,
10.17.),
14,15. of the same Chapter) "How shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?,
and how shall they Preach, except they be sent?",
But if Teaching be the cause of Faith, why doe not all beleeve?,
"These things are written, that you may know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.",
10.7. giveth he any Commission to them, other than this, "As ye go, Preach, saying, the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand;" that is, that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, the King which was to come.,
30.),
21.),
"Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall life; and they are they that testifie of mee.",
26.),
For when our Saviour (verse 26.),
had said to Martha, "Beleevest thou this?",
she answereth (verse 27.),
"Yea Lord, I beleeve that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world;" Therefore this Article alone is faith sufficient to life eternall; and more than sufficient is not Necessary.,
"These things are written that yee might beleeve, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that beleeving yee might have life through his name.",
"Every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.",
"whosoever beleeveth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God.",
"Who is hee that overcommeth the world, but he that beleeveth that Jesus is the Son of God?",
"See (saith the Eunuch) here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?,
And hee answered and said, I beleeve that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.",
"Though we, or an Angell from Heaven preach any other Gospell unto you, than that wee have preached unto you, let him bee accursed.",
Hereby yee shall know the Spirit of God; every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.",
11, 12, &c.) "Other Foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus is the Christ.,
If any mans work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward: If any mans work shall bee burnt, he shall suffer losse; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.",
The day of Judgment, is the day of the Restauration of the Kingdome of God; and at that day it is, that St. Peter tells us (2 Pet.,
3. v.7, 10, 12.),
For who is there that does not see, that they who beleeve Jesus to be the Son of the God of Israel, and that the Israelites had for God the Omnipotent Creator of all things, doe therein also beleeve, that God is the Omnipotent Creator of all things?,
Or how can a man beleeve, that Jesus is the King that shall reign eternally, unlesse hee beleeve him also risen again from the dead?,
In summe, he that holdeth this Foundation, Jesus Is The Christ, holdeth Expressely all that hee seeth rightly deduced from it, and Implicitely all that is consequent thereunto, though he have not skill enough to discern the consequence.,
The men to whom St. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, next after the Ascension of our Saviour, asked him, and the rest of the Apostles, saying, (Act.,
"Men and Brethren what shall we doe?",
to whom St. Peter answered (in the next verse) "Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.",
"What shall I doe to inherit eternall life?",
1.17.),
"The Just shall live by Faith;" not every one, but the Just; therefore Faith and Justice (that is, the Will To Be Just, or Repentance) are all that is Necessary to life eternall.,
What Each Of Them Contributes Thereunto  Seeing then it is Necessary that Faith, and Obedience (implyed in the word Repentance) do both concurre to our Salvation; the question by which of the two we are Justified, is impertinently disputed.,
Neverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make manifest in what manner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it is said, that we are to be Justified by the one, and by the other.,
And in this sense onely it is, that a man is called Just, or Unjust; and that his Justice Justifies him, that is, gives him the title, in Gods acceptation, of Just; and renders him capable of Living By His Faith, which before he was not.,
And in case a Subject be forbidden by the Civill Soveraign to professe some of those his opinions, upon what grounds can he disobey?,
Christian Kings may erre in deducing a Consequence, but who shall Judge?,
Shall a private man Judge, when the question is of his own obedience?,
or shall any man Judg but he that is appointed thereto by the Church, that is, by the Civill Soveraign that representeth it?,
or if the Pope, or an Apostle Judge, may he not erre in deducing of a consequence?,
OF SPIRITUALL DARKNESSE FROM MISINTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE     The Kingdome Of Darknesse What  Besides these Soveraign Powers, Divine, and Humane, of which I have hitherto discoursed, there is mention in Scripture of another Power, namely, (Eph.,
), that of "the Rulers of the Darknesse of this world," (Mat.,
), "the Principality of Beelzebub over Daemons," that is to say, over Phantasmes that appear in the Air: For which cause Satan is also called (Eph.,
2.),
"the Prince of the Power of the Air;" and (because he ruleth in the darknesse of this world) (Joh.,
11.),
Whence comes it, that in Christendome there has been, almost from the time of the Apostles, such justling of one another out of their places, both by forraign, and Civill war?,
And so we come to erre, by "giving heed to seducing Spirits," and the Daemonology of such "as speak lies in Hypocrisie," (or as it is in the Originall, 1 Tim.,
"That if a King at the Popes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeresies, and being excommunicate for the same, doe not give satisfaction within a year, his Subjects are absolved of the bond of their obedience.",
But when by such words, the nature of qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be changed, it is not Consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of God, or a vaine and impious Conjuration.,
For hee never said, that of what Bread soever, any Priest whatsoever, should say, "This is my Body," or, "This is Christs Body," the same should presently be transubstantiated.,
"That all the Power of the Enemy, all the Host of the Devill, all Assaults and Phantasmes of Satan, may be driven away by this Creature of Oyle.",
And for the Infant that is to be Baptized, he is subject to many Charms; First, at the Church dore the Priest blows thrice in the Childs face, and sayes, "Goe out of him unclean Spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost the Comforter.",
"Eate not the Bloud, for the Bloud is the Soule;" that is "the Life.",
But that the Souls of the Faithfull, are not of their own Nature, but by Gods speciall Grace, to remaine in their bodies, from the Resurrection to all Eternity, I have already I think sufficiently proved out of the Scriptures, in the 38.,
Answer To The Text On Which Beza Infereth  That The Kingdome Of Christ Began At The Resurrection The words are (Marke 9.1.),
"Verily, I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not tast of death, till they have seene the Kingdome of God come with power.",
And then there is another place more difficult: For when the Apostles after our Saviours Resurrection, and immediately before his Ascension, asked our Saviour, saying, (Acts.1.6.),
1.9, 10.),
Againe, if the Kingdome of God began (as Beza on that place (Mark 9.1.),
would have it) at the Resurrection; what reason is there for Christians ever since the Resurrection to say in their prayers, "Let thy Kingdome Come"?,
If then this Kingdome were to come at the Resurrection of Christ, why is it said, "some of them" rather than all?,
"If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?",
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus, &c." So that they saw Christ in Glory and Majestie, as he is to come; insomuch as "They were sore afraid.",
And thus the promise of our Saviour was accomplished by way of Vision: For it was a Vision, as may probably bee inferred out of St. Luke, that reciteth the same story (ch.,
28.),
(where the same is again related;) for our Saviour charged them, saying, "Tell no man the Vision untill the Son of man be Risen from the dead.",
Psalm, "Thou shalt Tread upon the Lion and the Adder, the young Lion and the Dragon thou shalt Trample under thy feet.",
40.),
When King Solomon, (the civill Soveraigne of Israel) consecrated the Temple hee had built, (2 Kings 8.),
And first there are the words of Solomon (Ecclesiastes 12.7.),
"Then shall the Dust return to Dust, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God that gave it.",
Which may bear well enough (if there be no other text directly against it) this interpretation, that God onely knows, (but Man not,) what becomes of a mans spirit, when he expireth; and the same Solomon, in the same Book, (Chap.,
That is, none knows but God; Nor is it an unusuall phrase to say of things we understand not, "God knows what," and "God knows where.",
3.19.),
"That which befalleth the Sons of Men, befalleth Beasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dyeth, so doth the other; yea, they have all one breath (one spirit;) so that a Man hath no praeeminence above a Beast, for all is vanity.",
ver.3.),
15.),
The Elect are the onely children of the Resurrection; that is to say the sole heirs of Eternall Life: they only can die no more; it is they that are equall to the Angels, and that are the children of God; and not the Reprobate.,
35.),
"O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure:" What were this to Purgatory, if Augustine had not applied the Wrath to the fire of Hell, and the Displeasure, to that of Purgatory?,
"Wee went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us to a moist place;" and other the like texts, (with which the Doctors of those times entended to adorne, or extend their Sermons, or Commentaries) haled to their purposes by force of wit?,
But what then can bee the meaning of those our Saviours words?,
29.),
"What shall they doe which are Baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?,
why also are they Baptized for the dead?",
3. where it is said that they which built Stubble, Hay, &c. on the true Foundation, their work shall perish; but "they themselves shall be saved; but as through Fire:" This Fire, he will have to be the Fire of Purgatory.,
59.),
But it is evident the Fire and Purging here mentioned, is the same whereof the Prophet Zachary speaketh (chap.,
9.),
"I will bring the third part through the Fire, and will Refine them, &c." And St. Peter after him (1 Epist.,
7.),
"That the triall of your Faith, which is much more precious than of Gold that perisheth, though it be tryed with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and glory at the Appearing of Jesus Christ;" And St. Paul (1 Cor.,
13.),
The Fire shall trie every mans work of what sort it is.",
But St. Peter, and St. Paul speak of the Fire that shall be at the Second Appearing of Christ; and the Prophet Zachary of the Day of Judgment: And therefore this place of S. Mat.,
"Agree with thine Adversary quickly, whilest thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the Adversary deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into prison.,
Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou has paid the uttermost farthing.",
"Whosoever is angry with his Brother without a cause, shall be guilty in Judgment.,
But whosoever shall say, Thou Foole, shall be guilty to hell fire.",
Shall not all Judicature appertain to Christ, and his Apostles?,
"Make yee friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when yee faile, they may receive you into Everlasting Tabernacles.",
"Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome:" Therefore, saith hee, there is Remission of sins after this life.,
But if that which Beza sayes in his notes on this place be well observed, there is none that will not see, that in stead of Paynes, it should be Bands; and then there is no further cause to seek for Purgatory in this Text.,
18.),
for the singularity of his fasting, that he had a Devill; and of our Saviour, because he said, hee that keepeth his sayings should not see Death In Aeternum, (John 8.,
"Now we know thou hast a Devill; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead:" And again, because he said (John 7.,
20.),
"They went about to kill him," the people answered, "Thou hast a Devill, who goeth about to kill thee?",
Why Our Saviour Controlled It Not  Which doctrine if it be not true, why (may some say) did not our Saviour contradict it, and teach the Contrary?,
nay why does he use on diverse occasions, such forms of speech as seem to confirm it?,
But when our Saviour speaketh to the Devill, and commandeth him to go out of a man, if by the Devill, be meant a Disease, as Phrenesy, or Lunacy, or a corporeal Spirit, is not the speech improper?,
or can there be a corporeall Spirit in a Body of Flesh and Bone, full already of vitall and animall Spirits?,
Are there not therefore Spirits, that neither have Bodies, nor are meer Imaginations?,
The Scriptures Doe Not Teach That Spirits Are Incorporeall  Our Saviour, immediately after the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a Dove, is said by St. Matthew (Chapt.,
1.),
1.),
And whereas in the verses following, he is said "to have been taken up by the Devill into the Holy City, and set upon a pinnacle of the Temple," shall we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the Devill, or carryed thither by violence?,
What then can be the meaning of this place, other than that he went of himself into the Wildernesse; and that this carrying of him up and down, from the Wildernesse to the City, and from thence into a Mountain, was a Vision?,
Conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of St. Luke, that hee was led into the Wildernesse, not By, but In the Spirit: whereas concerning His being Taken up into the Mountaine, and unto the Pinnacle of the Temple, hee speaketh as St. Matthew doth.,
But if there be no Immateriall Spirit, nor any Possession of mens bodies by any Spirit Corporeall, it may again be asked, why our Saviour and his Apostles did not teach the People so; and in such cleer words, as they might no more doubt thereof.,
And I find that there are Spirits Corporeal, (though subtile and Invisible;) but not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them; And that the Bodies of the Saints shall be such, namely, Spirituall Bodies, as St. Paul calls them.,
17.),
And the second was, that "they should not make to themselves any Image to Worship, of their own Invention.",
But the inward thoughts of men, which appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes of our Honoring, and these goe by the name of WORSHIP, in Latine, CULTUS.,
For the Commandement is, "Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven image.",
For we read not, that the Priest, or any other did worship the Cherubins; but contrarily wee read (2 Kings 18.4.),
And therefore from the Cherubins, or Brazen Serpent, to the Images of mans devising; and from the Worship commanded by God, to the Will-Worship of men, the argument is not good.,

"These are thy Gods O Israel;" and where the Images of Laban (Gen.,

But to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the doctrine of Government and Obedience?,
Or who will not obey a Priest, that can make God, rather than his Soveraign; nay than God himselfe?,
Powring In Of Soules  For the cause of the Soule of Man, they say, Creatur Infundendo, and Creando Infunditur: that is, "It is Created by Powring it in," and "Powred in by Creation.",
What man, that has his naturall Senses, though he can neither write nor read, does not find himself governed by them he fears, and beleeves can kill or hurt him when he obeyeth not?,
For who is there, that knowing there is so great danger in an error, when the naturall care of himself, compelleth not to hazard his Soule upon his own judgement, rather than that of any other man that is unconcerned in his damnation?,
And are not the Scriptures, in all places where they are Law, made Law by the Authority of the Common-wealth, and consequently, a part of the Civill Law?,
If I find my selfe amongst the Idolaters of America, shall I that am a Christian, though not in Orders, think it a sin to preach Jesus Christ, till I have received Orders from Rome?,

4. verse 1.),
But what reason is there for it?,
Is it because such opinions are contrary to true Religion?,
Is it because they be contrary to the Religion established?,
Is it because they tend to disorder in Government, as countenancing Rebellion, or Sedition?,
For what is it for men to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places of Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom?,
Or what is it, without Authority from the Civill Soveraign, to excommunicate any person, but to take from him his Lawfull Liberty, that is, to usurpe an unlawfull Power over their Brethren?,
For who is there, that beleeving this to be true, will not readily obey him in whatsoever he commands?,
And the number of Presbyters encreasing, the Presbyters of the chief City or Province, got themselves an authority over the parochiall Presbyters, and appropriated to themselves the names of Bishops: And this was a second knot on Christian Liberty.,
But these are contrary Faculties; the former being grounded upon principles of Truth; the other upon Opinions already received, true, or false; and upon the Passions and Interests of men, which are different, and mutable.,
Chapter, I would have this added, "That every man is bound by Nature, as much as in him lieth, to protect in Warre, the Authority, by which he is himself protected in time of Peace.",
Seeing therefore such contribution is every where, as a thing inevitable, (notwithstanding it be an assistance to the Enemy,) esteemed lawfull; as totall Submission, which is but an assistance to the Enemy, cannot be esteemed unlawfull.,
